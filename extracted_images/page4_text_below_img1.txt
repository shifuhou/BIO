Figure 2. Comparative analysis of the effects of hypoxia and CoCl2 on UC-MSC metabolism. UC-
MSCs were cultured for 24 and 48 h under different O2 levels (21%, 5%, <1%) or CoCl2 concentrations
(10 µM and 250 µM); cells were treated with the mTOR dual inhibitor INK-128 as a positive control for
a quiescent state. To assess both the oxidative metabolism and the extracellular acidiﬁcation rate of UC-
MSC, OCR and ECAR were measured, respectively, with a Seahorse XF24 Analyzer. Three measures
were performed after each drug injection. (A,B) Schematic image of the metabolic modulator injection
sequence and the parameters that could be obtained with the OCR and ECAR assays. (A) OCR proﬁle
throughout the experiment, (C) basal respiration, (D) ATP-linked respiration, (E) spare capacity,
and (F) oxygen maximal consumption. (B) ECAR proﬁle throughout the experiment, (G) glycolysis,
(H) glycolytic capacity, (I) glycolytic reserve, and (J) non-glycolytic acidiﬁcation. Spare capacity (OCR)
and glycolytic reserve (ECAR), not represented in the image, were calculated using the formulas
(maximal respiration—ATP-linked respiration) and (glycolytic capacity—glycolysis), respectively.
Protein level analysis of (K) COX IV and (L) p-LDHA/LDHA and the (M) respective representative
images, performed through Western blot. The values were normalized by the expression of the
loading control calnexin (CNX). The values are represented as means with SEM of at least three
independent experiments. Statistical signiﬁcance considered when * p < 0.05%, ** p < 0.01, and
*** p < 0.001.
