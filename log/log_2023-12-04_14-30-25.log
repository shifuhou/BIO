 Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been consistently reported as promising candi-
dates in functional tissue engineering and regenerative therapies [1–3]. The umbilical cord
comprises a speciﬁc stem cell niche where precise oxygen (O2) levels are paramount to
maintain and optimize stem cell function. In this tissue, umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem
cells (UC-MSCs) reside under hypoxic conditions, ranging from less than 1% O2 (severe
hypoxia) to 5% O2 (moderate hypoxia) [4].
The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) complex has emerged as one of the main
components of hypoxia response in most cell lines [5,6]. One of its isomers, HIF-1α, is a
transcriptional factor regulated by O2 and mobilized by hypoxia, with the crucial role of
suppressing mitochondrial respiration while increasing glycolytic enzyme expression [6].
Given that MSCs reside under these hypoxic physiological settings, in vitro culture un-
der atmospheric oxygen concentrations (21% O2, normoxia) can be detrimental to the
therapeutic value of MSCs, by hindering their plasticity, proliferation, and clonogenic
capacity [7].
In recent years, hypoxia preconditioning has been acknowledged as an adequate
priming technique to both enhance and preserve MSC bioactivity and biological identity,
respectively [8]. Nevertheless, studies on hypoxia preconditioning predominantly show
the effects of moderate hypoxia on MSC differentiation and expansion—with several au-
thors reporting an increase in proliferation following hypoxic treatment [9–11]. However,

severe hypoxia may have underlying advantages and might be key to promoting a hypo-
proliferative state that safeguards the cell and guarantees its longevity. In fact, numerous
organisms and cell lines temporarily cease cellular activity as a protective mechanism
against adverse environmental conditions (e.g., nutrient depletion) [12,13]. This transitory
arrest allows the cell to escape cellular senescence, DNA damage and oxidative stress asso-
ciated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [14], and this preconditioning technique
might be beneﬁcial for the long-term survival of MSCs.
Quiescence is frequently associated with a suppression in global protein synthesis,
metabolic activity, and energetic demand [14]. In this regard, the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a key role acting as a sensor and integrator of a large
variety of environmental cues (e.g., growth factors, nutrients, and O2 tension) that are linked
to cell cycle arrest, metabolic quiescence, and biosynthetic requirements [15]. Moreover,
the pharmacological inhibition of both mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) with
INK-128 has been proven to induce a reversible “paused-like” state in mouse embryonic
stem cells (mESCs) and bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs) [16–19].
While hypoxic settings are primarily induced by decreasing O2 concentrations, some
chemical hypoxia-mimetic agents (e.g., cobalt chloride) have been indiscriminately used as
a substitute for physical hypoxia, despite the still elusive effects prompted by this alternate
method [20]. The use of CoCl2 also allows us to distinguish the hypoxic effects produced
speciﬁcally by HIF-1α-related pathways.
Based on these theoretical considerations, in the present study, we aimed to perform a
comparative characterization of different hypoxic settings on the behavior of UC-MSCs,
focusing on proliferation and metabolism. We also aimed to determine whether severe
hypoxia, either physical or chemical, could prompt a mTOR-dependent quiescent state in
UC-MSCs.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were ﬁrst reported in 1960 [1]. These cells attach themselves
to plastic culture ﬂasks in a similar form to ﬁbroblasts, and are deﬁned as adult stem cells with
adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic properties. MSCs are deﬁned by criteria established by
the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy: (1) they are plastic adherent; (2) they have the
potential for three-lineage diﬀerentiation (adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic); (3) they have positive
surface markers (CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166) and negative surface markers (CD11b, CD19,
CD14, CD45, and HLA-DR) [2].

MSCs are considered to be a promising treatment for rare and intractable diseases, as these cells
have the immune privilege (they do not cause immune reactions when transplanted into a person),
and have demonstrated therapeutic eﬃcacy in various diseases through their paracrine action [3,4].
Such secretions of proteins—which maintain patient homeostasis, remove causative substances,
and regenerate damaged tissue—are the main therapeutic mechanism of MSCs [5,6]. Consequently,
the dosage of MSCs needs to be relatively high compared to other stem cell therapies.
The number of stem cells currently used in clinical trials ranges from 107 to 109 cells [7]. Therefore,
producing sufficient numbers of MSCs is very important in MSC therapy [8,9]. In order to produce a
sufficient number of MSCs from a single donor, continuous, long-term cultures are needed. However,
this long-term culture inevitably induces MSC senescence, resulting in the reduction of their multipotency
and therapeutic efficacy [10–12]. Therefore, the promotion of cell proliferation while retaining MSC
stemness in the early stages of the primary cultivation is crucial [13]. In order to address this issue,
attempts have been made to simulate the stem cell niche in vitro.
One source of MSCs is Wharton’s jelly, which is found in the umbilical cord. Umbilical cord blood,
tissue, and stem cells reside in a hypoxic state [14]. Previous studies have reported that the exposure of
MSCs to hypoxic conditions increased their proliferation and decreased their doubling time [15–17]. In the
umbilical cord, the amnion membrane wraps tightly around the umbilical cord [14]. This compresses
Wharton′s jelly, suggesting that WJ-MSC exists under much higher pressure than normal atmospheric
pressure [14,18,19]. Based on this rationale, we hypothesized that exposure to hypoxia and high-pressure
conditions could mimic the de novo environment of the umbilical cord. We speculated that applying
physical forces, particularly pressure, during manufacturing would enhance the yields and proliferation
without promoting the senescence of WJ-MSCs.
Thus, wehereevaluatedtheinfluenceofpressurestimuliontheproliferation, stemness, andtherapeutic
efficacy of WJ-MSCs.

  In order to produce a
sufficient number of MSCs from a single donor, continuous, long-term cultures are needed. However,
this long-term culture inevitably induces MSC senescence, resulting in the reduction of their multipotency
and therapeutic efficacy [10–12]

 Analysis process: In the given paragraph, the focus is on the production of a sufficient number of MSCs (Mesenchymal Stem Cells) from a single donor. It mentions the need for continuous, long-term cultures to achieve this. However, it also states that this long-term culture leads to MSC senescence, which results in a reduction in their multipotency and therapeutic efficacy. 

Conclusion: No, the article is not specifically about the growth of certain cells in different oxygen concentration environments. It is more concerned with the challenges of producing enough MSCs and their senescence during long-term culture.
