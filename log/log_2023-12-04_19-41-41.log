 Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been consistently reported as promising candi-
dates in functional tissue engineering and regenerative therapies [1–3]. The umbilical cord
comprises a speciﬁc stem cell niche where precise oxygen (O2) levels are paramount to
maintain and optimize stem cell function. In this tissue, umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem
cells (UC-MSCs) reside under hypoxic conditions, ranging from less than 1% O2 (severe
hypoxia) to 5% O2 (moderate hypoxia) [4].
The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) complex has emerged as one of the main
components of hypoxia response in most cell lines [5,6]. One of its isomers, HIF-1α, is a
transcriptional factor regulated by O2 and mobilized by hypoxia, with the crucial role of
suppressing mitochondrial respiration while increasing glycolytic enzyme expression [6].
Given that MSCs reside under these hypoxic physiological settings, in vitro culture un-
der atmospheric oxygen concentrations (21% O2, normoxia) can be detrimental to the
therapeutic value of MSCs, by hindering their plasticity, proliferation, and clonogenic
capacity [7].
In recent years, hypoxia preconditioning has been acknowledged as an adequate
priming technique to both enhance and preserve MSC bioactivity and biological identity,
respectively [8]. Nevertheless, studies on hypoxia preconditioning predominantly show
the effects of moderate hypoxia on MSC differentiation and expansion—with several au-
thors reporting an increase in proliferation following hypoxic treatment [9–11]. However,

severe hypoxia may have underlying advantages and might be key to promoting a hypo-
proliferative state that safeguards the cell and guarantees its longevity. In fact, numerous
organisms and cell lines temporarily cease cellular activity as a protective mechanism
against adverse environmental conditions (e.g., nutrient depletion) [12,13]. This transitory
arrest allows the cell to escape cellular senescence, DNA damage and oxidative stress asso-
ciated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [14], and this preconditioning technique
might be beneﬁcial for the long-term survival of MSCs.
Quiescence is frequently associated with a suppression in global protein synthesis,
metabolic activity, and energetic demand [14]. In this regard, the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a key role acting as a sensor and integrator of a large
variety of environmental cues (e.g., growth factors, nutrients, and O2 tension) that are linked
to cell cycle arrest, metabolic quiescence, and biosynthetic requirements [15]. Moreover,
the pharmacological inhibition of both mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) with
INK-128 has been proven to induce a reversible “paused-like” state in mouse embryonic
stem cells (mESCs) and bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs) [16–19].
While hypoxic settings are primarily induced by decreasing O2 concentrations, some
chemical hypoxia-mimetic agents (e.g., cobalt chloride) have been indiscriminately used as
a substitute for physical hypoxia, despite the still elusive effects prompted by this alternate
method [20]. The use of CoCl2 also allows us to distinguish the hypoxic effects produced
speciﬁcally by HIF-1α-related pathways.
Based on these theoretical considerations, in the present study, we aimed to perform a
comparative characterization of different hypoxic settings on the behavior of UC-MSCs,
focusing on proliferation and metabolism. We also aimed to determine whether severe
hypoxia, either physical or chemical, could prompt a mTOR-dependent quiescent state in
UC-MSCs.
