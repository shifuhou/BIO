 Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been consistently reported as promising candi-
dates in functional tissue engineering and regenerative therapies [1–3]. The umbilical cord
comprises a speciﬁc stem cell niche where precise oxygen (O2) levels are paramount to
maintain and optimize stem cell function. In this tissue, umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem
cells (UC-MSCs) reside under hypoxic conditions, ranging from less than 1% O2 (severe
hypoxia) to 5% O2 (moderate hypoxia) [4].
The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) complex has emerged as one of the main
components of hypoxia response in most cell lines [5,6]. One of its isomers, HIF-1α, is a
transcriptional factor regulated by O2 and mobilized by hypoxia, with the crucial role of
suppressing mitochondrial respiration while increasing glycolytic enzyme expression [6].
Given that MSCs reside under these hypoxic physiological settings, in vitro culture un-
der atmospheric oxygen concentrations (21% O2, normoxia) can be detrimental to the
therapeutic value of MSCs, by hindering their plasticity, proliferation, and clonogenic
capacity [7].
In recent years, hypoxia preconditioning has been acknowledged as an adequate
priming technique to both enhance and preserve MSC bioactivity and biological identity,
respectively [8]. Nevertheless, studies on hypoxia preconditioning predominantly show
the effects of moderate hypoxia on MSC differentiation and expansion—with several au-
thors reporting an increase in proliferation following hypoxic treatment [9–11]. However,

severe hypoxia may have underlying advantages and might be key to promoting a hypo-
proliferative state that safeguards the cell and guarantees its longevity. In fact, numerous
organisms and cell lines temporarily cease cellular activity as a protective mechanism
against adverse environmental conditions (e.g., nutrient depletion) [12,13]. This transitory
arrest allows the cell to escape cellular senescence, DNA damage and oxidative stress asso-
ciated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [14], and this preconditioning technique
might be beneﬁcial for the long-term survival of MSCs.
Quiescence is frequently associated with a suppression in global protein synthesis,
metabolic activity, and energetic demand [14]. In this regard, the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a key role acting as a sensor and integrator of a large
variety of environmental cues (e.g., growth factors, nutrients, and O2 tension) that are linked
to cell cycle arrest, metabolic quiescence, and biosynthetic requirements [15]. Moreover,
the pharmacological inhibition of both mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) with
INK-128 has been proven to induce a reversible “paused-like” state in mouse embryonic
stem cells (mESCs) and bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs) [16–19].
While hypoxic settings are primarily induced by decreasing O2 concentrations, some
chemical hypoxia-mimetic agents (e.g., cobalt chloride) have been indiscriminately used as
a substitute for physical hypoxia, despite the still elusive effects prompted by this alternate
method [20]. The use of CoCl2 also allows us to distinguish the hypoxic effects produced
speciﬁcally by HIF-1α-related pathways.
Based on these theoretical considerations, in the present study, we aimed to perform a
comparative characterization of different hypoxic settings on the behavior of UC-MSCs,
focusing on proliferation and metabolism. We also aimed to determine whether severe
hypoxia, either physical or chemical, could prompt a mTOR-dependent quiescent state in
UC-MSCs.

 Introduction
Oxygen is essential for the normal viability and function of eukaryotic cells due to its
role in mitochondrial energy production and as a co-factor/substrate for many enzymes.
Under conditions of low oxygen tension, normal cells undergo a metabolic switch from
a predominance of mitochondrial metabolism towards increased glycolysis in order to
maintain sufﬁcient ATP levels [1]. Hypoxia then activates a signalling pathway which
is predominantly governed by stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible factors, principally the
transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) [2,3], which activates a program
regulating the expression of numerous genes involved in metabolic processes, including
glycolysis [1], angiogenesis [4], pH regulation [5], and wound healing [6]. The signiﬁcance
of the discovery of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability via the HIF signalling
pathways was recognised by the award of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
to William G. Kaelin Jr, Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe, and Gregg L. Semenza.
In solid tumours, uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells and disorganised growth
of blood vessels creates regions of low oxygen tension that limit the supply of nutrients and
oxygen. The HIF-1 transcription factor is highly overexpressed in a broad range of human

 Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have great potential for regenerative medical applications
in various diseases, have gained increasing research interest over the past few decades. MSCs have
been isolated from several sources, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, amniotic
ﬂuid, periosteum, and fetal tissues [1]. They have the capacity to develop into bone, cartilage, muscle,
marrow, tendon, adipose tissues, and vessels, depending on environmental stimuli [2]. Moreover,
they regulate the immune response through various soluble factors and cell surface proteins, such as
indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, nitric oxide, interleukin (IL)-10, and toll-like receptors [2]. Although the
multitude of MSC studies have increased our understanding of MSC biology and paved the way to
preclinical and clinical trials, more studies to delineate the mechanism of MSCs and to improve the
efﬁcacy of MSC therapy remain urgently needed.
Hypoxia is a crucial physiological and pathological phenomenon that regulates a wide range
of cellular processes, in addition to signaling pathway transduction. In bone marrow and adipose

However, in the laboratory, they are commonly incubated under normoxic conditions (approximately
21% atmospheric oxygen). Conversely, in preclinical and clinical applications, MSC-based therapeutics
are delivered at ischemic and hypoxic injured sites. Therefore, it has been suggested that optimization
of hypoxic preconditioning for MSC expansion is important for clinical development of MSC-based
therapies [4]. Accumulating evidence has shown that hypoxic preconditioning of MSCs promotes cell
survival, proliferation, motility, metabolic changes, and cell retention in vitro and in vivo [5–8]. Our
previous study revealed that hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs facilitate neovascularization in ischemic
disease [9]. Therefore, establishing a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying MSC
growth and survival under hypoxia is required for the development of MSC-based therapeutics and
improvement of their efﬁcacy.
The 78-kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family and
is widely used as a marker for endoplasmic reticulum(ER) stress [10]. GRP78 plays a key role in cell
survival and apoptosis through interaction with protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
(PERK) [11]. Various studies have indicated that GRP78 expression is elevated during hypoxia and
that GRP78 protects cardiomyocytes and neurons from hypoxia-induced apoptosis [12,13]. In addition,
upregulation of GRP78 expression by physiological peptides, pharmacological agents, and gene
transfer protects cardiomyocytes from hypoxic/ischemic injury [14–16]. However, the effect of GRP78
on hypoxia in MSCs remains elusive. In this study, we evaluated hypoxia-induced expression of
GRP78 in cultured MSCs and investigated the role of GRP78 in the regulation of MSC proliferation
and migration. Furthermore, we demonstrated that hypoxic preconditioning prevents cell death of
transplanted MSCs in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model.

 Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have great potential for regenerative medical applications
in various diseases, have gained increasing research interest over the past few decades. MSCs have
been isolated from several sources, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, amniotic
