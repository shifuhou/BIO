 Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been consistently reported as promising candi-
dates in functional tissue engineering and regenerative therapies [1–3]. The umbilical cord
comprises a speciﬁc stem cell niche where precise oxygen (O2) levels are paramount to
maintain and optimize stem cell function. In this tissue, umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem
cells (UC-MSCs) reside under hypoxic conditions, ranging from less than 1% O2 (severe
hypoxia) to 5% O2 (moderate hypoxia) [4].
The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) complex has emerged as one of the main
components of hypoxia response in most cell lines [5,6]. One of its isomers, HIF-1α, is a
transcriptional factor regulated by O2 and mobilized by hypoxia, with the crucial role of
suppressing mitochondrial respiration while increasing glycolytic enzyme expression [6].
Given that MSCs reside under these hypoxic physiological settings, in vitro culture un-
der atmospheric oxygen concentrations (21% O2, normoxia) can be detrimental to the
therapeutic value of MSCs, by hindering their plasticity, proliferation, and clonogenic
capacity [7].
In recent years, hypoxia preconditioning has been acknowledged as an adequate
priming technique to both enhance and preserve MSC bioactivity and biological identity,
respectively [8]. Nevertheless, studies on hypoxia preconditioning predominantly show
the effects of moderate hypoxia on MSC differentiation and expansion—with several au-
thors reporting an increase in proliferation following hypoxic treatment [9–11]. However,

severe hypoxia may have underlying advantages and might be key to promoting a hypo-
proliferative state that safeguards the cell and guarantees its longevity. In fact, numerous
organisms and cell lines temporarily cease cellular activity as a protective mechanism
against adverse environmental conditions (e.g., nutrient depletion) [12,13]. This transitory
arrest allows the cell to escape cellular senescence, DNA damage and oxidative stress asso-
ciated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [14], and this preconditioning technique
might be beneﬁcial for the long-term survival of MSCs.
Quiescence is frequently associated with a suppression in global protein synthesis,
metabolic activity, and energetic demand [14]. In this regard, the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a key role acting as a sensor and integrator of a large
variety of environmental cues (e.g., growth factors, nutrients, and O2 tension) that are linked
to cell cycle arrest, metabolic quiescence, and biosynthetic requirements [15]. Moreover,
the pharmacological inhibition of both mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) with
INK-128 has been proven to induce a reversible “paused-like” state in mouse embryonic
stem cells (mESCs) and bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs) [16–19].
While hypoxic settings are primarily induced by decreasing O2 concentrations, some
chemical hypoxia-mimetic agents (e.g., cobalt chloride) have been indiscriminately used as
a substitute for physical hypoxia, despite the still elusive effects prompted by this alternate
method [20]. The use of CoCl2 also allows us to distinguish the hypoxic effects produced
speciﬁcally by HIF-1α-related pathways.
Based on these theoretical considerations, in the present study, we aimed to perform a
comparative characterization of different hypoxic settings on the behavior of UC-MSCs,
focusing on proliferation and metabolism. We also aimed to determine whether severe
hypoxia, either physical or chemical, could prompt a mTOR-dependent quiescent state in
UC-MSCs.

 Introduction
Oxygen is essential for the normal viability and function of eukaryotic cells due to its
role in mitochondrial energy production and as a co-factor/substrate for many enzymes.
Under conditions of low oxygen tension, normal cells undergo a metabolic switch from
a predominance of mitochondrial metabolism towards increased glycolysis in order to
maintain sufﬁcient ATP levels [1]. Hypoxia then activates a signalling pathway which
is predominantly governed by stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible factors, principally the
transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) [2,3], which activates a program
regulating the expression of numerous genes involved in metabolic processes, including
glycolysis [1], angiogenesis [4], pH regulation [5], and wound healing [6]. The signiﬁcance
of the discovery of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability via the HIF signalling
pathways was recognised by the award of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
to William G. Kaelin Jr, Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe, and Gregg L. Semenza.
In solid tumours, uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells and disorganised growth
of blood vessels creates regions of low oxygen tension that limit the supply of nutrients and
oxygen. The HIF-1 transcription factor is highly overexpressed in a broad range of human

 Analysis process: The given paragraph mentions the topic of wound healing. It does not explicitly mention the growth of certain cells in different oxygen concentration environments, so we need to analyze the information in the paragraph further.

The paragraph states that "wound closure is a complex biological process that involves many cellular and biochemical events." This indicates that the article is likely discussing the process of wound healing rather than the growth of specific cells.

Additionally, the paragraph does not mention anything about different oxygen concentration environments or the growth of cells in such conditions. Instead, it focuses on the complexity and importance of wound healing.

Conclusion: No, the article is not about the growth of certain cells in different oxygen concentration environments.

 Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were ﬁrst reported in 1960 [1]. These cells attach themselves
to plastic culture ﬂasks in a similar form to ﬁbroblasts, and are deﬁned as adult stem cells with
adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic properties. MSCs are deﬁned by criteria established by
the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy: (1) they are plastic adherent; (2) they have the
potential for three-lineage diﬀerentiation (adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic); (3) they have positive
surface markers (CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166) and negative surface markers (CD11b, CD19,
CD14, CD45, and HLA-DR) [2].

MSCs are considered to be a promising treatment for rare and intractable diseases, as these cells
have the immune privilege (they do not cause immune reactions when transplanted into a person),
and have demonstrated therapeutic eﬃcacy in various diseases through their paracrine action [3,4].
Such secretions of proteins—which maintain patient homeostasis, remove causative substances,
and regenerate damaged tissue—are the main therapeutic mechanism of MSCs [5,6]. Consequently,
the dosage of MSCs needs to be relatively high compared to other stem cell therapies.
The number of stem cells currently used in clinical trials ranges from 107 to 109 cells [7]. Therefore,
producing sufficient numbers of MSCs is very important in MSC therapy [8,9]. In order to produce a
sufficient number of MSCs from a single donor, continuous, long-term cultures are needed. However,
this long-term culture inevitably induces MSC senescence, resulting in the reduction of their multipotency
and therapeutic efficacy [10–12]. Therefore, the promotion of cell proliferation while retaining MSC
stemness in the early stages of the primary cultivation is crucial [13]. In order to address this issue,
attempts have been made to simulate the stem cell niche in vitro.
One source of MSCs is Wharton’s jelly, which is found in the umbilical cord. Umbilical cord blood,
tissue, and stem cells reside in a hypoxic state [14]. Previous studies have reported that the exposure of
MSCs to hypoxic conditions increased their proliferation and decreased their doubling time [15–17]. In the
umbilical cord, the amnion membrane wraps tightly around the umbilical cord [14]. This compresses
Wharton′s jelly, suggesting that WJ-MSC exists under much higher pressure than normal atmospheric
pressure [14,18,19]. Based on this rationale, we hypothesized that exposure to hypoxia and high-pressure
conditions could mimic the de novo environment of the umbilical cord. We speculated that applying
physical forces, particularly pressure, during manufacturing would enhance the yields and proliferation
without promoting the senescence of WJ-MSCs.
Thus, wehereevaluatedtheinfluenceofpressurestimuliontheproliferation, stemness, andtherapeutic
efficacy of WJ-MSCs.
