 Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were ﬁrst reported in 1960 [1]. These cells attach themselves
to plastic culture ﬂasks in a similar form to ﬁbroblasts, and are deﬁned as adult stem cells with
adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic properties. MSCs are deﬁned by criteria established by
the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy: (1) they are plastic adherent; (2) they have the
potential for three-lineage diﬀerentiation (adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic); (3) they have positive
surface markers (CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166) and negative surface markers (CD11b, CD19,
CD14, CD45, and HLA-DR) [2].

MSCs are considered to be a promising treatment for rare and intractable diseases, as these cells
have the immune privilege (they do not cause immune reactions when transplanted into a person),
and have demonstrated therapeutic eﬃcacy in various diseases through their paracrine action [3,4].
Such secretions of proteins—which maintain patient homeostasis, remove causative substances,
and regenerate damaged tissue—are the main therapeutic mechanism of MSCs [5,6]. Consequently,
the dosage of MSCs needs to be relatively high compared to other stem cell therapies.
The number of stem cells currently used in clinical trials ranges from 107 to 109 cells [7]. Therefore,
producing sufficient numbers of MSCs is very important in MSC therapy [8,9]. In order to produce a
sufficient number of MSCs from a single donor, continuous, long-term cultures are needed. However,
this long-term culture inevitably induces MSC senescence, resulting in the reduction of their multipotency
and therapeutic efficacy [10–12]. Therefore, the promotion of cell proliferation while retaining MSC
stemness in the early stages of the primary cultivation is crucial [13]. In order to address this issue,
attempts have been made to simulate the stem cell niche in vitro.
One source of MSCs is Wharton’s jelly, which is found in the umbilical cord. Umbilical cord blood,
tissue, and stem cells reside in a hypoxic state [14]. Previous studies have reported that the exposure of
MSCs to hypoxic conditions increased their proliferation and decreased their doubling time [15–17]. In the
umbilical cord, the amnion membrane wraps tightly around the umbilical cord [14]. This compresses
Wharton′s jelly, suggesting that WJ-MSC exists under much higher pressure than normal atmospheric
pressure [14,18,19]. Based on this rationale, we hypothesized that exposure to hypoxia and high-pressure
conditions could mimic the de novo environment of the umbilical cord. We speculated that applying
physical forces, particularly pressure, during manufacturing would enhance the yields and proliferation
without promoting the senescence of WJ-MSCs.
Thus, wehereevaluatedtheinfluenceofpressurestimuliontheproliferation, stemness, andtherapeutic
efficacy of WJ-MSCs.

 Analysis process: 

The paragraph mentions that MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) are considered a promising treatment for rare and intractable diseases. It also states that MSCs have immune privilege, meaning they do not cause immune reactions when transplanted into a person. Additionally, the paragraph mentions that MSCs have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in various diseases through their paracrine action. 

Based on this information, it can be inferred that the article is not specifically about the growth of certain cells in different oxygen concentration environments. Instead, it appears to focus on the potential use of MSCs for treating diseases and their mechanisms of action. 

Conclusion: No.
