Fig. 9 Simulations of various ROS-mediated protein deactivation activation oxygen level. The simulations were completed with activation oxygen
level of 5% (left), 10% (central) and 15% (right). Each simulation was completed with the same 1000 QMC parameter value sets. The red dots represent
the optimal oxygen level for each parameter set, showing the minimum commitment time in each simulation
