Fig. 4 a Simulated cell cycle commitment time under different oxygen tensions at the nominal model parameter setting. b Compiled literature
experimental data of the hypoxic proliferation rate. The ratio between hypoxic and normoxic proliferation rate for each set of the literature data
(S1-S15) is plotted. A list of the corresponding references is included in the Supporting Information (Additional file 3). The simulation results from
this study (Sim) are shown for the swept oxygen tensions
