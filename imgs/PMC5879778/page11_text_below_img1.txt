Fig. 5 Derivative-based global sensitivity measure (DGSM) results for the selected model parameters. Relative parameter global sensitivity is
shown as the calculated G-score on the z-axis. Eight different parameters have been evaluated under seven oxygen tensions (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.08,
0.1, 0.15 and 0.2)
