Hif-1 enhances epithelial cell migration through induction of lysyl oxidases. (A) Hif1a+/+ or Hif1a–/– PTECs were cultured under normoxia or 
hypoxia for 6 days. Migration was analyzed by introducing a scratch into the epithelial layer and measuring scratch width, i.e., migration distance, 
at 0, 4, and 24 hours. Hypoxic Hif1a+/+ cells (top panel) displayed complete scratch closure after 24 hours, whereas the scratch was still apparent 
in hypoxic Hif1a–/– cells (lower panel); compare images labeled with #. Original magnification, ×100. Graph shows fold increase of hypoxic (Hx) 
Hif1a+/+ (black bars) and Hif1a–/– (gray bars) PTECs compared with their respective normoxic (Nx) migration. *P < 0.05. (B) Quantitative real-time 
PCR analysis of Pgk (4.2-fold induction at 12 hours), Vegf (13.8-fold increase at 12 hours), Mdr-1 (4.6-fold increase), Pai-1 (3.2-fold induction 
at 12 hours), Lox and LoxL2 (2.4- and 2.5-fold induction at 12 and 6 hours, respectively) mRNA in Hif1a+/+ (+/+) or Hif1a–/– (–/–) PTECs exposed 
to hypoxia for 0, 6, and 12 hours. Gene expression was normalized to 18S mRNA. (C) Hif1a+/+ PTECs were cultured under hypoxia for 6 days; 
2 hours prior to wounding, lysyl oxidase inhibitors BAPN or BCS were added and cell migration monitored over 30 hours. Hx, untreated control 
cells (hypoxia without inhibitor). Original magnification, ×100.
