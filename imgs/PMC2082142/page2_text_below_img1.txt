in cancer progression and metastasis (23, 24), and HIF-1 has been 
identified as a regulator of EMT in several cancer cell lines (25, 26). 
We therefore hypothesized that hypoxia through HIF-1 may pro-
mote fibrogenesis via stimulation of EMT in addition to the induc-
tion of gene products that promote ECM accumulation. During 
EMT, epithelial cells dedifferentiate, lose cell polarity and epithelial 
surface markers, induce the expression of mesenchymal markers, 
and display phenotypic alterations resulting in the formation of a 
more motile fibroblast-like cell (27). We previously reported that 
interstitial cells positive for fibroblast-specific proteinâ€“1 (FSP-1; 
also known as S100A4), which in part originate from renal epithe-
lial cells through EMT, play an important role in the progression 
of renal fibrosis (20). Although a large number of molecules that 
contribute to the induction of EMT have been identified, little is 
known about the cellular stresses that trigger EMT (22).
