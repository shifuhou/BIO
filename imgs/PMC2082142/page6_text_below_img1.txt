Pai-1, Lox, and LoxL2 (19, 23, 39, 40) that we found in kidneys on 
day 8 after UUO compared with contralateral kidneys (Figure 4B). 
In addition, we observed upregulation of Collagen 1α1 and Collagen 
18α1 in response to ureteral ligation, which is consistent with fibro-
sis development in our model (18). Taken together, these results 
suggest that UUO kidneys are hypoxic and display protein and gene 
expression changes consistent with Hif activation.
