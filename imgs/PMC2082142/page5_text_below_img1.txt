cortex can vary greatly but are estimated at 5% O2 (equivalent to 
approximately 38 mmHg), with approximately 1%–2% O2 (8–15 
mmHg) in the renal medulla. Although HIF-α stabilization can 
occur at oxygen tensions lower than 5% O2, HIF proteins are typi-
cally not detectable unless a substantial decrease in oxygen supply 
has occurred (e.g., as a result of radiocontrast exposure or carbon 
monoxide poisoning) or when HIF-α degradation is inhibited phar-
macologically (e.g., by cobalt chloride) (36, 37). In the UUO model, 
tubulointerstitial fibrosis becomes evident 4 days after ligation and 
progresses so that by day 8, renal tissue is characterized by marked 
expansion of the interstitial area due to increased fibroblast num-
bers, enhanced ECM deposition, and increased mononuclear cell 
infiltration, which is associated with tubular atrophy and apoptosis 
(38). Tissue hypoxia was detected using pimonidazole hydrochlo-
ride, which forms protein adducts in cells that experience an oxygen 
level of approximately 1% O2. Pimonidazole staining revealed that 
subcortical tubular epithelial cells in UUO kidneys experienced 
a discrepancy between oxygen supply and demand as early as 24 
hours after ligation (Figure 4A; 1d UUO), which was sustained 
throughout the development of fibrosis (Figure 4A; 8d UUO). In 
contrast, contralateral kidneys on day 1 after ligation did not show
