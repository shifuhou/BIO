Hif-1 promotes EMT in PTECs. (A) Upper-left panel: Schematic illustrating the genetic make-up of mice 
used for the in vitro EMT studies. Mice expressed the ROSA26RLacZ reporter (top) in conjunction with the 
PEPCK-cre transgene, in the presence (+) or absence (–) of the floxed Hif1a conditional allele (bottom). 
Triangles indicate the presence of loxP sites. Hif1a+/+ or Hif1a–/– PTECs were cultured under normoxia or 
hypoxia for 0–5 days. Cells were stained for β-gal (red) and the mesenchymal marker FSP-1 (green; origi-
nal magnification, ×400). Epithelial cells undergoing EMT stained both red and green (arrows). (B) Percent 
FSP-1–positive epithelial cells in Hif1a+/+ or Hif1a–/– cultures exposed to normoxia (N) or hypoxia (H) for 1–5 
days. Scale bars represent mean values ± SEM. *P < 0.01 (C) Western blot analysis for ZO-1, α-SMA, and 
CTGF in Hif1a+/+ or Hif1a–/– PTECs exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 3 or 6 days. PTECs were stimulated 
with 3 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 3 days as a positive control for α-SMA and CTGF induction. β-Actin is included 
as loading control. (D) Neutralizing Ab against TGF-β (α-TGFβ Ab) (1 μg/ml) inhibits TGF-β1 induction of 
CTGF in PTECs. (E) Western blot analysis for α-SMA and CTGF in Hif1a+/+ or Hif1a–/– PTECs cultured for 
6 days under either normoxia or hypoxia in the absence or presence (+) of neutralizing Ab against TGF-β.
