tion was ablated in UUO kidneys 8 days after ligation, as Hif1a 
mRNA levels were similar in control and mutant mice, possibly 
due to increased Hif1a mRNA expression in nonrecombined cells, 
and warrants further investigation. Therefore, the analysis of Hif-1 
target gene expression in mutant kidneys was noninformative in 
day 8 UUO kidneys, limiting our investigation of fibrogenesis in 
UUO kidneys to morphometric and histological studies.
