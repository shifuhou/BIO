Model proposing a role for HIF-1 in the progression of CKD. Tubuloin-
terstitial hypoxia is due to glomerulosclerosis and capillary rarefaction, 
which is commonly found in kidneys from patients with CKD. As a con-
sequence of hypoxia in renal epithelial cells HIF-1Î± is stabilized, result-
ing in increased expression of lysyl oxidase genes and other profibro-
genic factors, thus promoting EMT and the accumulation of ECM.
