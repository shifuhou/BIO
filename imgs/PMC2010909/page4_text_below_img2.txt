RESULTS
A total of 399 steady-state measure-
ments in 20 spheroids of EMT6/Ro cells
and of 289 steady-state readings in 20
spheroids of V-79-171B cells were re-
corded. The. diameters of the EMT6/Ro
spheroids ranged from 386 to 1900 ,um; the
V-79-171B spheroids investigated were
376-1052 Km in diameter. Fig. 1 shows
3 representative Po2 profiles in EMT6/Ro
(a) and in V-79-171B cells (b) at 3 different
sizes. All profiles are characterized by a
decrease of 02 in the medium directly
surrounding the spheroid, thus lowering
the Po2 at the surface of the spheroid
(arrows in Fig.
1) considerably below
that in the bulk of the medium. The
shapes of the Po2 profiles within the
spheroids were parabolic in small spheroids
but the gradients were steep from the
edge towards the interior with a central
plateau in larger spheroids. The steep
decrease of Po2 did not continue beyond
220 + 34 ,um from the rim in EMT6/Ro
spheroids and beyond 188 + 31 ,um from
