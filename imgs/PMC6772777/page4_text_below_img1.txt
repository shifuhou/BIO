DISCUSSION
Lowered oxygen cultures favor proliferation and survival
of CNS stem cells
Standard conditions for the culture of mammalian cells are 37°C in
a gas atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Thus, ambient temper-
ature is adjusted to reﬂect core mammalian body temperature and
CO2 is adjusted to reﬂect approximate venous concentrations,
whereas in striking contrast, O2 levels in culture are not adjusted to
normal physiological levels. At sea level, unhumidiﬁed room air
contains 21% O2, and a 95% air–5% CO2 mixture contains 20%
O2. Alveolar air contains 14% O2, arterial O2 concentration is
12%, venous O2 levels are 5.3%, and mean tissue O2 concentration
is 3% (Guyton and Hall, 1996). In mammalian brain, interstitial
tissue O2 levels range from ;1 to 5% (Goda et al., 1997; Liu et al.,
1997; Tammela et al., 1997). Data gathered from extensive sam-
pling suggest that mean brain O2 levels in adult rat and fetal sheep
are 1.6% (Koos and Power, 1987; Silver and Erecinska, 1988).
Physiological tissue O2 levels in some brain regions are even lower
(Table 1).
