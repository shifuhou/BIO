Figure 4. Epo mimics the lowered O2 effect on dopaminergic differentia-
tion. A, Representative images of TH1 cells grown in the presence or
absence of Epo and anti-Epo antibody and in lowered or 20% O2 condi-
tions. All reagents were added to E12 mesencephalic precursor cultures
throughout cell expansion and differentiation (10 d total) in lowered or 20%
O2. Epo supplementation signiﬁcantly increased TH1 cell numbers in 20%
O2 cultures (n 5 6; p , 0.05). Epo neutralizing antibody decreased TH1
cell numbers in both lowered O2 (n 5 6; p , 0.01) and 20% O2 cultures (n 5
6; p , 0.05). Scale bar, 20 mm. B, Effects of Epo and anti-Epo blocking
antibody on dopamine neuron yield. C, Epo positively inﬂuences dopami-
nergic neuron yield in 20% O2 in a dose-dependent manner.
