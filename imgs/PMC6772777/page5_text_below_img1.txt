cell number was observed during the proliferation phase when most
of the cells are nestin1 precursors. The increase in cell number was
also maintained after mitogen withdrawal when proliferation over-
all was vastly reduced. The effects of lowered oxygen were not
limited to precursors derived from the ventral mesencephalon.
CNS precursors derived from the E14 lateral ganglionic emi-
nences, the anlage of the striatum, and from E14 cortex showed
very similar results to those reported here for mesencephalic pre-
cursor proliferation, cell death, and clonal growth (data not
shown). Although more cells were present in differentiated cultures
in lowered O2, our data show that the proportions of neurons and
glia were generally similar in the two culture conditions. In neural
tissue, there is one supporting, although specialized, precedent for
mitogenic activity of lowered O2 in neural crest-derived carotid
body chromafﬁn cells (Nurse and Vollmer, 1997). These dopami-
nergic glomus cells are functionally specialized O2-sensitive che-
moreceptors and so would be expected to be speciﬁcally responsive
to changes in O2 levels in the carotid artery. Our results show that
lowered oxygen enhances the proliferation and survival of CNS
stem cells.
