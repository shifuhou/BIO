in all nuclear extracts assayed. Several conclusions fol-
low from these results. First, mouse ES cells are unique
among cell lines studied to date based on their high level
of HIF-1(cid:97) expression under nonhypoxic conditions. Sec-
ond, homologous recombination disrupted Hif1a gene
expression leading to partial and complete loss of HIF-1(cid:97)
protein in Hif1a+/− and Hif1a−/− ES cells, respectively.
These results indicate that the targeted gene, designated
Hif1atm1jhu, is a null allele. Third, HIF-1 DNA-binding
activity was not detected in Hif1a−/− ES cells, indicating
the absence of any other protein capable of dimerizing
with HIF-1(cid:98) and recognizing a HIF-1 binding site.
