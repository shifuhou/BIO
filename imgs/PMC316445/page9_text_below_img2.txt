Figure 8. PECAM immunohistochemistry. Comparison of
E8.5–E8.75 Hif1a+/+ (A) and Hif1a−/− (B) embryos reveals no
apparent differences in vascularization. In contrast, the vascu-
larization of the E9.25 Hif1a−/− embryo (D) is markedly abnor-
mal when compared with a stage-matched Hif1a+/+ embryo (C).
Anomalous endothelial-lined vascular structures are present in
the cranial region (arrow in D), no branchial arch vessels have
formed, the lumen of the heart tube is not apparent, and the
diameter of the dorsal aorta (DA) is irregular. (BA1) First bran-
chial arch; (V) Ventricle.
