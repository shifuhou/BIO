Figure 3. Expression of VEGF mRNA in ES cells and cystic
embryoid bodies. (A) ES cells. Hif1a+/+ and Hif1a−/− cells were
incubated in complete medium at 20% O2 (N), complete me-
dium at 1% O2 (H), or glucose-deficient medium at 20% O2 (−G)
for 16 hr. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by blot hybrid-
ization with 32P-labeled VEGF cDNA (top) and 18S rRNA oli-
gonucleotide (bottom) probes. (B) Embryoid bodies. ES cells
were cultured for 4 days in methylcellulose to induce differen-
tiation and then exposed to 20% (N) or 0% (H) O2 for 16 hr prior
to RNA isolation and blot hybridization as described above.
