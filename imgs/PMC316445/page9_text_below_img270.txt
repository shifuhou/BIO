and Hif1a−/− embryos. Aliquots (15 µg) of nuclear extracts from
nonhypoxic (N) and hypoxic (H) Hif1a+/+ ES cells (lanes 1,2) and
aliquots (120 µg) of lysates prepared from Hif1a+/+ (WT; lanes
3–8) and Hif1a−/− (M; lane 9) embryos of the indicated gesta-
tional age were analyzed using antibodies specific for HIF-1(cid:97)
(top), HIF-1(cid:98) (middle), or as a control (C), topoisomerase I (bot-
tom).
