Figure 2. Expression of genes encoding glucose transporters
and glycolytic enzymes. The glycolytic pathway is shown at
left. Symbols for genes encoding the respective enzymes are
coded by font according to the mRNA expression pattern (nor-
malized to 18S rRNA) in ES cells cultured under nonhypoxic (N)
or hypoxic (H) conditions for 16 hr (lanes 1–6 at right) as follows:
(1) (bold) increased expression in hypoxic Hif1a+/+ cells, loss of
induction in Hif1a+/− cells, and loss of basal and induced ex-
pression in Hif1a−/− cells; (2) (bold and italicized) no effect of
hypoxia on expression in Hif1a+/+ cells but decreased expression
in hypoxic Hif1a+/− and Hif1a−/− cells; (3) (italicized) no effect of
hypoxia on expression in Hif1a+/+ cells but decreased expression
in hypoxic and nonhypoxic Hif1a−/− cells; (4) (plain) no effect of
hypoxia or HIF-1(cid:97) deficiency on expression. mRNA expression
in Hep3B cells was also assayed (lanes 7,8). The indicated genes
encode the following proteins: (GLUT1 and GLUT3) glucose
transporter 1 and 3; (HK1 and HK2) hexokinase 1 and 2; (GPI)
(PFKL) phosphofructokinase L;
glucosephosphate isomerase;
(ALDA and ALDC) aldolase A and C; (TPI) triosephosphate
(GAPDH) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydroge-
isomerase;
nase; (PGK1) phosphoglycerate kinase 1; (PGM) phosphogluco-
mutase; (ENO1) enolase 1; (PKM) pyruvate kinase M; (LDHA)
lactate dehydrogenase A. GLUCOSE (EXT) and GLUCOSE
(INT) refer to extracellular and intracellular glucose, respec-
tively.
