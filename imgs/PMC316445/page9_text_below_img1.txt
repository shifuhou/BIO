Figure 7. Supravital dye staining. Ten-somite Hif1a+/+ (left)
and Hif1a−/− (right) embryos have been treated with Nile blue
sulfate. Punctate staining indicative of cell death is apparent
within the mesenchymal compartment of the fore- and mid-
brain region in the left neural fold of the Hif1a−/− embryo and is
absent in the corresponding region of the Hif1a+/+ embryo. Non-
specific trapping of dye in the heart lumen also allowed analysis
of cardiac morphogenesis. Arrows over the embryos have been
placed the same distance apart to demonstrate the constriction
between ventricle and outflow tract of the Hif1a−/− embryo. The
Hif1a−/− heart is not stained, suggesting absence of a patent
lumen.
