Each filter was subsequently stripped and rehybridized
with an 18S rRNA probe to demonstrate the presence of
equal amounts of RNA in each lane (data not shown). In
addition, autoradiographs were serially hybridized with
different probes. For example, the LDHA blot shown was
stripped and rehybridized to generate the PKM blot
shown. Therefore, the different patterns of expression
reflect varying effects of HIF-1(cid:97) deficiency on the expres-
sion of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. These results
indicate that HIF-1 coordinately regulates the expression
of at least 13 genes encoding proteins involved in the
anaerobic synthesis of ATP by conversion of extracellu-
lar glucose to intracellular lactate. Furthermore, this
regulation is complex because in some cases (groups 2
and 3), it appears that the level of gene expression repre-
sents the net effect of multiple positive and/or negative
regulators such that HIF-1 is required to maintain, rather
than to induce, gene expression in hypoxic ES cells. As
further evidence of the specific effects of HIF-1(cid:97) defi-
ciency, expression of ODC mRNA (encoding ornithine
decarboxylase) was induced to the same degree in hyp-
oxic Hif1a+/+, Hif1a+/−, and Hif1a−/− ES cells (data not
shown). Therefore, hypoxia-inducible ODC gene expres-
sion is not HIF-1(cid:97)-dependent. Expression of other hyp-
oxia-inducible genes (encoding adrenomedullin, cyclo-
oxygenase-2, 5(cid:56)-ecto-nucleotidase, endothelin-1, EPO,
HO1, iNOS, platelet-derived growth factor-B, transfer-
rin, and transforming growth factor-(cid:98)
1) was demon-
strated in Hep3B cells but could not be detected in wild-
type or HIF-1(cid:97)-deficient ES cells (data not shown).
