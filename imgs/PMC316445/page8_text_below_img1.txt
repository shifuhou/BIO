Figure 6. Histologic analysis. Sections through the cranial region of stage-matched Hif1a+/+ (A) and E9.75–E10.0 Hif1a−/− (C,E)
embryos are shown. A normal blood vessel (arrowhead in A) can be compared with the anomalous vascular structures contained within
the cephalic mesenchyme (arrowheads in C and E) of Hif1a−/− embryos, which also manifest prolapsed neural folds (NF) and a
deficiency of cranial mesenchyme (CM) relative to the Hif1a+/+ embryo. Sections through the cardiac region of stage-matched Hif1a+/+
(B) and E9.75–E10.0 Hif1a−/− (D,F) embryos are shown. Hyperplasia of presumptive myocardium (M) and anomalous tissue (arrows in
F) are evident within the enlarged pericardial cavity (PC) and along the pericardium (P). (AV) Atrioventricular canal; (BA1) first
branchial arch; (NT) neural tube; (OV) otic vesicle; (OT) ventricular outflow tract.
