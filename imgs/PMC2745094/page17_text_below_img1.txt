Figure 3. Correspondence between computational target predictions and observed protein changes
Analogous results were observed using the transfection data sets (Supplementary Fig. 8). a,
Performance of programs that consider site conservation. Plotted is the average protein
derepression (± standard error) of genes with ≥1 conserved or non-conserved 7-8mer 3′-UTR
site (grey) and of genes predicted to be miR-223 targets. The number of quantified proteins in
each set is in parenthesis. b, Recognition of an adenosine (A) opposite the first nucleotide of
the miRNA. The cumulative plot of protein changes after miR-181 transfection compares
proteins from messages with no seed-matched 3′-UTR site to those from messages with the
indicated single 3′-UTR site. c, Relationship between the scores of predicted targets and protein
derepression. Predictions corresponding to quantified proteins were divided into three equal-
