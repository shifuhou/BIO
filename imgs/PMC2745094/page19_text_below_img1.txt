Figure 4. Comparison of protein and mRNA changes accompanying miR-223 loss
a, Protein and mRNA changes for quantified proteins deriving from messages with at least one
8mer 3′-UTR site (blue, n = 55) or at least one 7mer (orange, an additional 250 proteins). The
least-squares best fit to the 8mer data are shown (blue line), as are reference lines (grey), which
both have slope of 1.0. Vertical error bars indicate 25th and 75th percentiles for independent
measurements of protein changes. Horizontal error bars indicate standard errors of mRNA
changes from three biological replicates, one of which was also used for the SILAC
experiments. b, Protein and mRNA changes for quantified proteins deriving from messages
without 7-8mer 3′-UTR sites, plotted as in a. One of seven random cohorts is plotted here; the
other six are in Supplementary Fig. 6. c, Distribution of the indicated reference-set mRNAs
and quantified proteins with respect to mRNA expression, as indicated by the array signals
from cultured neutrophils. d, Response of quantified proteins and their respective mRNAs to
mir-223 deletion, considering those messages with 7-8mer 3′-UTR sites, grouped by mRNA
expression.
