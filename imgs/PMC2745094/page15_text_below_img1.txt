Figure 1. The impact of transfected miRNAs on protein output
a, Canonical miRNA seed-matched sites2. b, The fraction of repressed proteins deriving from
messages with miR-124 3′-UTR sites (filled orange bar). At each repression cutoff, the number
of repressed proteins from messages without 3′-UTR sites (indicated in the open bar) was used
to calculate the additional fraction expected by chance to have a site (dashed line, with the
corresponding number of repressed proteins indicated below the dashed line). Above the
dashed line is the surplus number of repressed proteins deriving from messages with sites. c,
Response of proteins from messages with single miR-124 3′-UTR sites. Plotted is the fraction
of proteins that change at least to the degree indicated on the x axis. Proteins from messages
with multiple 3′-UTR sites were not considered. 6mer sites that were part of larger sites were
not included in the 6mer distribution, and 7mers that were part of 8mers were not included in
the 7mer distributions. d, Efficacy of single 3′-UTR sites when pooling data from miR-124,
miR-1 and miR-181 transfections, plotted as in c. e, ORF and 3′-UTR targeting efficacy. Plotted
is the average change (± standard error) of protein and corresponding mRNA for quantified
proteins from messages with at least one 8mer in the ORF (n = 83) or 3′ UTR (n = 87)
corresponding to the transfected miRNA (excluding messages with sites in both ORF and 3′
UTR).
