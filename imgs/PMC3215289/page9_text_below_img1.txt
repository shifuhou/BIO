Figure 1. Schematic of HIF and c-Myc effects on carbon metabolism
Both HIF and c-Myc act on multiple targets to regulate carbon utilization. HIF targets are
shown in blue, c-Myc targets in red, and targets regulated by both HIF and c-Myc in green.
Arrows are included to designate effects on flux through cellular pathways, with blue arrows
showing pathways promoted by HIF, red arrows those promoted by c-Myc and green arrows
by both.
