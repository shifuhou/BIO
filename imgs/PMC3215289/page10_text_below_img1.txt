Figure 2. Hypoxic, HIF and c-Myc effects on protein translation
While c-Myc promotes ribosome biogenesis and expression of components of the
translational machinery, hypoxia and HIFs modulate growth factor signaling pathways that
normally upregulate translation. c-Myc targets and c-Myc promoted processes are
highlighted in red, while direct HIF targets and hypoxia promoted processes are shown in
blue.
