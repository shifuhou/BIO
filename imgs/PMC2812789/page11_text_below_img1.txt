PKM2 is tyrosine phosphorylated and inhibited by FGFR1 in cancer cells with oncogenic or
overexpressed FGFR1. (A) Schematic representation of PKM2. The six phosphorylated
tyrosine residues identified in the proteomics studies are indicated. (B) Immunoblotting (WB)
of 293T cell lysates for tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-PKM2 when coexpressed with the
constitutively active fusion protein 8p11 ZNF198-FGFR1 PR/TK or with FGFR1 in the
presence and absence of FGFR1 ligand (bFGF). (C) FGFR1 wild type (WT) but not a kinase
dead (KD) mutant inhibits PKM2 enzyme activity in 293T cells (*0.01 < P < 0.05; n.s., not
significant). The error bars represent the means ± SD from three independent experiments.
Relative PKM2 activity was normalized to that in control 293T cells. (D) Inhibition of FGFR1
by tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI258 (1 μM for 2 hours) results in increased PKM2 enzyme
activity in leukemia KG-1a (FOP2-FGFR1), breast cancer MDA-MB-134 (FGFR1), and lung
cancer H1299 cells (FGFR1) (*0.01< P < 0.05; **P < 0.01). Relative PKM2 activity was
normalized to that in control cells without TKI258 treatment.
