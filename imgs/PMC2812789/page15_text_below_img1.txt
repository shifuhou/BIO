Expression of PKM2 Y105F mutant in H1299 cells leads to decreased proliferation under
hypoxic conditions, increased oxidative phosphorylation and reduced tumor growth. (A)
Rescue expression of mPKM2 Y105F in H1299 cells results in reduced cell proliferation under
hypoxic conditions (1%) but not at normal oxygen tension (normoxic; 17% oxygen) compared
with cells expressing PKM2 WT or Y390F mutant. Cell proliferation was determined by the
increase in cell number 96 hours after seeding compared to that at seeding for each cell line
(T = 0). Error bars represent the means Â± SD from three independent experiments. (B) Y105F
rescue H1299 cells have a higher rate of oxygen consumption than do cells with mPKM2 WT.
(C) Y105F rescue H1299 cells show significantly reduced lactate production under normoxia.
