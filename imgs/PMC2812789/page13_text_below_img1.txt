Y105 phosphorylation disrupts formation of active, tetrameric PKM2 by releasing cofactor
FBP. (A) Incubation of a pY105 phosphopeptide attenuates the catalytic activity of FBP-loaded
recombinant PKM2 (rPKM2). Relative PKM2 activity was normalized to rPKM2 without
preincubation with FBP. The error bars represent the means ± SD from three independent
experiments. (B) Incubation of phospho-Y105 peptide leads to reduced formation of tetrameric,
active PKM2. rPKM2 (Myc-tagged) preincubated with FBP was incubated with each peptide,
followed by 0.025% glutaraldehyde cross-linking (+) before SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Parallel samples without cross-linking treatment (−)
were included as loading controls. The numbers represent the relative intensity of the specific
bands of PKM2 tetramers, which are normalized to the value of control sample without
treatment of peptide. (C) Phospho-Y105 peptide incubation results in release of FBP from
PKM2. [14C]FBP was incubated with rPKM2 and the unbound FBP was dialysed away. [14C]
FBP-soaked rPKM2 was incubated with the indicated peptides followed by dialysis to remove
the unbound FBP peptides. Retained [14C]FBP on PKM2 was measured with a scintillation
counter. (D) Inhibition of FGFR1 by TKI258 results in increased PKM2 enzyme activity in
rescue H1299 cells expressing mPKM2 WT or Y390F mutant, but not in cells expressing
mPKM2 Y105F and K433E mutants (*0.01 < P < 0.05; n.s., not significant). Relative PKM2
activity was normalized to WT cells without TKI258 treatment. (E) Phosphorylation of PKM2
at Y105 is detected by immunoblotting in rescue cells expressing mPKM2 WT, Y390F, or
K433E mutants, but not in cells expressing the Y105F mutant.
