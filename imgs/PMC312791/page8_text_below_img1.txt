Figure 5. Expression of total VEGF and VEGF isoforms. (a) Real-time RT–PCR determination of total VEGF isoform expression in ear
skin of K14-HIF-1(cid:1), K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD, and K14-VEGF164 transgenic mice and nontransgenic controls. Three mice from each geno-
type were analyzed, and VEGF mRNA levels are calculated relative to histone 3.3A in each sample. Total VEGF mRNA levels are
increased 80% in K14-HIF-1(cid:1) transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic controls (*P = 0.02, Student’s t-test). Total VEGF mRNA
is elevated 13-fold in K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic controls (*P < 0.0001, Student’s t-test), and
fourfold compared with K14-VEGF164 transgenic mice (†P = 0.0003, Student’s t-test). Total VEGF is elevated twofold in ear skin from
K14-VEGF164 transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic controls (*P = 0.02, Student’s t-test). (b) Real-time RT–PCR determina-
tion of VEGF isoform expression in ear skin of nontransgenic controls and K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD and K14-VEGF164 transgenic mice. PCR
primers flanking each indicated isoform and fluorescent TaqMan probes specific for each splice junction were used in the analysis
(Tober et al. 1998). VEGF isoforms in each sample were calculated with histone 3.3A as a reference. Triplicate determinations were
performed and the mean was used in calculations. Three to four mice were analyzed in each group (*P < 0.05, compared with level of
nontransgenic controls, Mann-Whitney U test; †P < 0.05 pattern of expression different from nontransgenic, ANOVA with maximum
likelihood test). (c) Calculation of the fold induction of each VEGF isoform in K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD and K14-VEGF164 transgenic mice
compared with nontransgenic controls. There is an equivalent 6- to 10-fold induction of each VEGF isoform in the K14-HIF1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD
transgenic mice, whereas only the 164 isoform is increased in K14-VEGF164 transgenic mice. The pattern of VEGF isoform induction
is significantly different in the two groups of transgenic mice (*P < 0.05, ANOVA with maximum likelihood test). (d) VEGF protein
levels in transgenic and nontransgenic mice. ELISA analysis of protein extracts from ear skin shows a 0.5- to 3-fold increase of VEGF
protein in the three separate K14-HIF-1a(cid:3)ODD transgenic mouse lines (#62, #19, and #71 in order of magnitude), and a twofold
increase in heterozygous K14-VEGF164 transgenic mice, compared with nontransgenic controls and K14-HIF-1(cid:1) transgenic mice
(*P < 0.05, Student’s t-test).
