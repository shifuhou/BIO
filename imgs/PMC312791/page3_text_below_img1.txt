Figure 2. Expression of HIF-1 target genes. Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are
expressed in both interfollicular epidermis and in the hair follicle outer root sheath of K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD transgenic mice. Low-level
signals for both GLUT-1 and VEGF are present in the hair follicle outer root sheath of K14-HIF-1(cid:1) transgenic mice, whereas neither
target gene is detectable in ear skin of nontransgenic mice. Bar, 20 Âµm.
