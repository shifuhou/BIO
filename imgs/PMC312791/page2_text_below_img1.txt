Figure 1. Generation and initial characterization of HIF-1(cid:1) transgenic mice. (a) Constructs used to target wild-type human HIF-1(cid:1)
or mutant HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD (deletion of the oxygen-dependent degradation domain; Huang et al. 1998) to basal keratinocytes (Munz et al.
1999). Amino acids spanning the ODD are indicated. (b) Redness and prominent vasculature of ear skin and roughness of coat are
evident in the K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD transgenic mice. K14-HIF-1(cid:1) transgenic mice are indistinguishable from nontransgenic controls. (c)
Histopathology of ears reveals an increase in blood vessels (see green arrowheads) in the dermis of K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD transgenic mice.
No inflammation or edema is detectable. (d) In situ hybridization with a 35S-labeled riboprobe specific for human HIF-1(cid:1). Both HIF-1(cid:1)
and HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD transgenes are expressed in basal keratinocytes of interfollicular epidermis and the hair follicle outer root sheath,
and appear to be expressed at the same level, as visually estimated from silver grain density. Bars in c and d are 20 Âµm.
