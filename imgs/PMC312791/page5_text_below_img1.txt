Figure 3. Blood vessel location, distribution, and permeability. (a) Immunohistochemistry for CD31 expression shows an increase in
the number of dermal capillaries beneath the epidermis in the K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD compared with either the K14-HIF-1(cid:1) transgenic
mice or nontransgenic controls. (b) Blood vessel morphology and multiplicity revealed by perfusion with biotinylated Lycopersicon
esculentum lectin (Thurston et al. 1999). Low power views show the marked increase in blood vessel density in the K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD
transgenic mice. High power views reveal that this increase is predominantly owing to an increase in capillaries with normal
morphology. Capillaries and small caliber vessels are concentrically arranged around hair follicles in the K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD transgenic
mice. The hair follicle sebaceous glands are peroxidase positive because of endogenous biotin (black arrows each lower panel in b). (c)
Quantification of microvasculature vessel length–density (Thurston et al. 1999) from lectin-perfused ears confirm a 66% increase in
blood vessel number in the K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD transgenic mice compared with either K14-HIF-1(cid:1) or nontransgenic mice (*P < 0.05,
Mann-Whitney U test). Eight 10× fields from two to six mice of each genotype were counted. (d) Fluorescent lectin staining in thick
sections shows that hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis in back skin of K14-HIF-1(cid:1)(cid:3)ODD transgenic mice (right panel) are
decorated with small blood vessels, whereas nontransgenic back skin (left panel) contains only sporadic microvessels in the same
locations. Bars, a and lower line of b, 20 µm; upper line of b, 150 µm.
