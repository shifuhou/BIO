15-LO mRNA expression and 15-LO protein in the WHHL rabbit atherosclerotic lesions colocalizes with macrophages and with
oxidized LDL epitopes. In situ hybridization was carried out with 3"S-labeled riboprobes in formal/sucrose-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections
(10 /Am) from upper thoracic aorta of a WHHL rabbit. (A) 15-LO antisense probe. (B) 15-LO nonhybridizing sense probe. (C) 5-LO antisense
probe. (Exposure time in A-C was 3 weeks.) (D) A serial section stained with hematoxylin and eosin. (E-I) Immunocytochemistry of the serial
sections (avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase system). (E) Antibody against MDA-modified LDL (MAL-2; 1:500 dilution). (F) Antibody
against human 15-LO protein that cross-reacts with rabbit 15-LO (goat antiserum, 1:500 dilution). (G) Antibody specific for macrophages
(RAM-11; 1:1000 dilution). (H) Antibody against native LDL apoprotein B (MB47; 1:500 dilution). (I) Nonimmune control for the
immunostaining. (Methyl green counter stain in E-I. Photographs in A-C were taken with polarized light epiluminescence; photographs in D-I
were taken with bright-field illumination. All 24x.)
