It has been proposed that low oxygen concentrations still allow the proliferation, but
decrease the differentiation rate of stem cell populations. Cell division in limited oxygen con-
centration conditions would thus ensure the self-renewal and maintenance of the stem cell
population, without any commitment to differentiation (reviewed in [1]). Our findings
strengthen the need to re-explore basic cancer cell biology issues in physioxia and not in artifi-
cial hyperoxia (21% oxygen concentration).
