Fig 1. Effect of oxygen concentration reduction on the proliferation of 2D monolayers and 3D spheroids derived from HCT116 cells. (A) Growth
curve of HCT116 cells grown in the presence of 21% or 5% oxygen. These data are the mean ± SD of four independent experiments. (B,C) Spheroids
prepared from monolayers of HCT116 cells maintained at the targeted oxygen concentration (21% or 5%) were grown in 96-well plates. (B) Representative
bright field microscopy images of spheroids grown at the indicated oxygen concentrations for three and six days. Scale bar is 100 μm. (C) Spheroids
volume was determined after three and six days (d3 and d6) of culture. Results are the mean ± SD of the measurements made in five independent
experiments: n = 88 spheroids (d3, 21%) n = 57 (d6, 21%), n = 80 (d3, 5%), n = 50 (d6, 5%).
