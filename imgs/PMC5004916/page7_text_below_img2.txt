Fig 2. Cell proliferation regionalization in 3D spheroids grown at 5% and 21% oxygen. HCT116
spheroids grown in the indicated conditions for three (d3) and six days (d6) were incubated with EdU for 24
hours prior to fixation and analysis. (A) Representative fluorescence microscopy images of cryosections from
spheroids grown at the indicated oxygen concentrations for three and six days and labeled with EdU (green)
and DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 100 Î¼m. (B) Percentage of EdU-positive cells relative to the distance from the
spheroid surface. The results are the mean +/-SD of five independent experiments with 4 to 5 spheroids
analyzed per condition in each experiment. Data were extracted from the automated segmentation and
quantification of images of cryosections cut along the spheroid center (see Methods). Arrows (blue: 5%,
green: 21% oxygen) indicate the In Depth Proliferation 50% index (IDP50) that is the distance from the surface
where 50% of cells are EdU-positive.
