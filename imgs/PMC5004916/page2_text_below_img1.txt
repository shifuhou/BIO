and 4%), for instance 4.4% in brain, 5.4% in liver and 9.5% in kidney. The lower oxygen partial
pressure values observed in tissues, compared to air, do not correspond to hypoxia, but to the
tissue physiological condition to maintain its homeostasis and should be called physioxia [2].
Hence, physioxia is the oxygen partial pressure in tissues that defines a threshold ensuring
proper physiological function [2]. For instance, it is assumed that oxygen partial pressure
above 35mmHg (4.6%) is sufficient to ensure normal oxygenation of the brain tissue. More-
over, results from various studies clearly indicate that tumor hypoxia corresponds to an oxygen
partial pressure that is lower relative to the physioxia of the respective normal tissue and not
relative to atmospheric normoxia [3, 4]. Genuine hypoxia in tissues and tumors is usually
detected by pimonidazole hydrochloride staining or EF5 reduction that occurs at oxygen par-
tial pressure lower than 10 mmHg (1.32%) [5] [6] [7].
