FIG. 4. Effects of hypoxia on myogenic gene expression and mRNA stability. (A) C2C12 cells were differentiated at different pO2 levels for 1
to 3 days. Temporal expression of myogenic genes was analyzed by Northern blotting of total RNA. Results are representative of at least three
independent experiments. (B) C2C12 cells and primary myoblasts were treated for the indicated period of time (in hours) in DM containing 5 (cid:4)g
of actinomycin D (ActD) per ml at 21% and 0.5% O2, respectively. Total RNA was prepared, and Northern blotting was done as described for
panel A. Relative band intensity was analyzed with NIH Image 1.63.
