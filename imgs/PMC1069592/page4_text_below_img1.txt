FIG. 2. Adaptation of myogenesis to hypoxia. (A) C2C12 cells were differentiated at different pO2 levels for 1 to 3 days, followed by 3 days of
differentiation at 21% O2. (B) C2C12 cells were differentiated at 0.5% O2 for 3, 6, or 12 days continuously, with a 3-day differentiation at 21% O2
for comparison. MyoÔ¨Åber formation was analyzed after hematoxylin staining (A and B). Results are representative of at least three independent
experiments. Bars, 50 (cid:4)m (A) and 100 (cid:4)M (B).
