FIG. 10. Effects of hypoxia on transcription activity of the myoD promoter. C2C12 cells that stably express the indicated myoD promoter-driven
luciferase reporter gene were allowed to undergo myogenic differentiation at 21 or 0.5% O2. Luciferase assays were performed at the indicated
time. (A) To better reﬂect the effects of hypoxia on myoD promoter activity, the hypoxia/normoxia ratio for each of the myoD promoter constructs
was normalized to the hypoxia/normoxia ratio for SV40 promoter-driven luciferase (pGL2). (B) C2C12 cells were induced to differentiate under
the indicated conditions. Total cell lysates were prepared in SDS sample buffer and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western
blotting for acetylated H3 and H4. Actin served as a loading control. Cells treated with 5 mM sodium butyrate (NaBut) served as a positive control
for acetylated histones, with 1/5 of the amount loaded in the other lanes. (C) C2C12 cells were induced to differentiate under the indicated
conditions. ChIP assays were performed with the rabbit anti-acetylated H3 or control rabbit IgG. The myoD promoter was ampliﬁed by PCR with
nested primers. The band intensities were analyzed with NIH Image 1.63 from two independent gel analyses (D).
