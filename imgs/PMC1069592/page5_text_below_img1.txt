FIG. 3. Role of cellular energy metabolism in myogenesis. (A) C2C12 cells were differentiated for 3 or 6 days at 21% O2 in the presence of
4.5 g of glucose per liter and NaN3 (0 or 100 (cid:4)M). (B) C2C12 cells were differentiated for 3 or 6 days at 21% O2 in the presence of 4.5 g of glucose
per liter and 2-deoxyglucose (0 or 100 mM) or in the presence of NaN3 (0 or 100 (cid:4)M) but without glucose. (C) C2C12 cells were differentiated
for 3 or 6 days at 0.5% O2 in glucose-free medium containing NaN3 (0 or 100 (cid:4)M). Cells were ﬁxed and stained for MHC (green) by
immunoﬂuorescence with propidium iodide (red) as a nuclear counterstain. Bars, 100 (cid:4)m (A, B) and 50 (cid:4)m (C).
