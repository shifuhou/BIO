FIG. 7. Effects of hypoxia on the expression of the myoD and myogenin genes in primary myoblasts. (A) Primary myoblasts were cultured in
differentiation medium for the indicated period of time (days) at 21 and 0.5% O2, respectively. Changes in the expression of myoD and myogenin
mRNA were investigated by Northern blotting. Levels of myoD and myogenin proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. (B) Primary myoblasts
were cultured in DM without glucose for the indicated period of time (days) at 21 and 0.5% O2, respectively. Levels of myoD and myogenin
proteins were analyzed by Western blotting.
