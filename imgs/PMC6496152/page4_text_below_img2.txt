Figure 1. Identiﬁcation of mRNA encoding EpoR and EpoR protein in rat L6 myoblasts and human myoblasts. L6 and human myoblasts were
cultured for 48 h in growth medium and mRNA was extracted for PCR analyses. (a) Ampliﬁcation products were visualized using agarose gel electro-
pohoresis. Size of the ampliﬁcation product of EpoR mRNA was 363 bp for rat myoblasts and 485 bp for human myoblasts, H2O PCR control water,
RT control without reverse transcriptase, PM molecular weight. (b) Western blotting of Jurkat cells and C2C12 cells used as positive controls and L6 rat
muscle, stained with anti-mouse EpoR rabbit polyclonal antibody. Western blotting revealed the 59 KDa band in human myoblasts and L6 myoblasts
(C2C12 cells used as control).
