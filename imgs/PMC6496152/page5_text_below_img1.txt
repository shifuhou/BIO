Figure 2. Effects of hypoxia and RhEpo on growth of cultured human and rat L6 myoblasts. (a1) Population growth kinetics of L6 myoblasts
cultured in both 21% and 1% O2 conditions in growth medium containing 0, 2 and 5 IU ⁄ mL of RhEpo. RhEpo was added to the medium at T0 and
T48h. (a2) Determination of doubling time of L6 myoblasts grown for 96 h in both 21% and 1% conditions in growth media containing RhEpo injected
at doses ranging from 0 to 10 IU ⁄ mL at T0 and T48h. (b1) Population growth kinetics of human primary myoblasts cultured in both 21% and 1% O2
conditions in growth media containing 0, 2 and 5 IU ⁄ mL of RhEpo. RhEpo was added to medium at T0 and T48h. (b2) Determination of doubling time
of L6 myoblasts grown for 96 h in both 21% and 1% conditions in growth medium containing RhEpo, injected at doses ranging from 0 to 10 IU ⁄ mL at
T0 and T48. Values are mean ± SE of three separate experiments in triplicate. *P £ 0.01, 21% versus 1% O2.
