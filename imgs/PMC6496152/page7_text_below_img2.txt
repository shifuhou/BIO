Figure 5. Expression of fast myosin heavy chain altered by hypoxia:
RhEpo did not prevent this. L6 myoblasts were cultured for 72 h in
growth medium containing 0–10 IU ⁄ mL RhEpo at 21% O2 and for 96 h
in differentiation medium at 21% or 1% O2. (a) Western blotting shows
expression of fast MHC and b-actin in L6 myoblasts non-treated (0) or
treated, with a range from 1 to 10 IU ⁄ mL of RhEpo. (b) Quantiﬁcation
of myosin heavy chain expression was carried out as ratio of myoge-
nin ⁄ b-actin. Western blots are representative of those obtained from three
different cultures. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *P £ 0.01, 21%
versus 1% O2.
