Figure 4. Effects of hypoxia and RhEpo on expression of myogenin
and fast myosin heavy chain. L6 myoblasts were cultured for 72 h
in growth medium containing 0–10 IU ⁄ mL RhEpo at 21% O2 and for
96 h in differentiation medium at 21% or 1% O2. (a) Western blotting
using anti-mouse myogenin rabbit polyclonal antibody and beta-actin.
(b) Quantiﬁcation of myogenin expression was carried out as ratio of
myogenin ⁄ b-actin. Western blots are representative of those obtained
from three different cultures. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
*P £ 0.01, 21% versus 1% O2.
