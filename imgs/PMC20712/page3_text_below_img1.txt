FIG. 1. Comparison of primary structures of mouse HLF and
HIF1(cid:97) gene products. (A) Identical amino acid ((cid:112)) and conservative
substitutions (.) are indicated. Dashes indicate deletions to maximize
the sequence similarity. Basic helix–loop–helix region and direct
repeats of PAS domain are boxed. The entire PAS domain is enclosed
in brackets. (B) Comparison of the basic amino acid sequence of Arnt
(33), dSim (17), AhR (34, 35), HIF1(cid:97) (15), HLF, and dTrh (18, 19).
Amino acids identical to those of HLF are boxed.
