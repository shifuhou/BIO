FIG. 6. Transcriptional regulation of the VEGF gene by a heterodimer
of HLF and Arnt. (A) Schematic representation of the VEGF gene
promoter region and reporter gene, and summary of the transfection
assay. The VEGF gene promoter and the HRE-deleted promoter regions
were PCR-amplified and ligated to the firefly luciferase reporter gene as
described. The VEGF HRE sequences were tandemly ligated to the
promoter of the heterologous SV40 promoter. Plasmid DNAs of a
reporter (2 (cid:109)g), effectors (1 (cid:109)g), and (cid:98)-galactosidase expressing pENL (1
(cid:109)g) were cotransfected, and expressed luciferase and (cid:98)-galactosidase
activities were determined. (B) EMSA experiment using the HRE
oligonucleotide of the VEGF gene. Combinations of various proteins
components and competitor DNA are indicated above the blot.
