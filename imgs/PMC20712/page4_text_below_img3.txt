FIG. 3. Coimmunoprecipitation, EMSA, and transient transfection
experiments. (A) Interaction of HLF or HIF1(cid:97) with Arnt was inves-
tigated by coimmunoprecipitation assay using extracts from Sf9 cells
transfected with baculovirus-carrying Arnt cDNA and 35S-labeled
HLF or HIF1(cid:97) proteins synthesized in the in vitro reticulocyte
translation system as described. Lanes 1 and 5, input proteins. (B)
EMSA experiment using the Epo HRE oligonucleotide. Combinations
of the reaction components are indicated above the blot. (C) Transient
transfection experiment in c4 cells. Combinations of effector and
reporter plasmids and their amounts ((cid:109)g) are indicated beneath the
chart. (D) Effects of hypoxic treatment on the transcription of the
reporter gene in Hep3B cells. Combinations of effector and reporter
plasmids used for transfection and their amounts ((cid:109)g) are indicated
below the chart. Cells were grown under normoxic (N, 21% O2) and
hypoxic (H, 1% O2) conditions.
