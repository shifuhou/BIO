Figure 8.
Incorporation of green BMSCs into cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells. Representative
fluroscence micrographs of peri-infarct area at 4 weeks after MI. A-B, GFP-positive cells
(arrow) is shown as a desmin-positive cardiomyocytes (red). Yellow in (B) indicates
cardiomyocytes derived from GFP-positive cells (× 1000). C-D, GFP-positive cells expressed
SMA (arrow). Yellow labeling indicates vascular smooth muscle cells derived from GFP-
positive cells (× 400). E. Percentage of GFP-positive cardiomyocytes. Total 15 sections were
examined in both groups (n = 6). Data are shown as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05. Bar scale, 20
μm.
