Figure 3. 
Growth of repair-deficient MEFs in 3% and 20% oxygen. (a) The replicative lifespans of 
three independent Balb/c MEF cultures maintained in 3% oxygen and two cultures 
maintained in 20% oxygen are shown. Error bars indicate the standard deviations. (b) 
Replicative lifespans and standard deviations of five Ku80−/− (grey) and three wild-type 
littermate (black) MEF cultures in 3% (circles) and 20% (squares) oxygen were determined. 
(c) The replicative lifespans and standard deviations of two Xpa−/− (grey) and two wild-type
