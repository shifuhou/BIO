Figure 4. 
MEFs accumulate high levels of oxidative DNA damage in 20% oxygen. (a) The Fpg-comet 
assay was performed on early passage C57Bl/6 MEFs cultured in 3% or 20% oxygen, 
immortal MEFs cultures derived and grown in 20% oxygen and mid-lifespan (PD 35) WI-38 
human fibroblasts cultured for more than 10 population doublings in 20% oxygen. The 
normalized average tail length is plotted. Each value represents the average of four 
independent experiments and at least 50 cells per determination. (b) Comet assay controls. 
WI38 and MEFs grown at the indicated oxygen concentrations and at the indicated 
population doublings were analysed for comet tail lengths before treatment with fpg. As a 
positive control, the normalized tail length of MEFs treated with hydrogen peroxide (100 
μM) is also shown. ( c) C57Bl/6 MEFs were derived and grown in 3% or 20% oxygen for up 
to 25 passages. The average percentage of metaphases from 4–5 independent cultures 
containing obvious chromosomal breaks or fragments is plotted. Error bars show s.e.m.
