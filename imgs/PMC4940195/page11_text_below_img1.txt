Low oxygen abolishes replicative senescence of MEFs. C57Bl/6 MEFs were used for all 
experiments. (a) MEFs were cultured in 20% or 3% oxygen, as indicated, and cell number 
was determined at each passage. The average and standard deviations of three independent 
cultures are shown. (b) MEFs cultured in 3% oxygen (black) were shifted at PD8, PD13 or 
PD19 to 20% oxygen (grey), or maintained in 3% oxygen. Cell number was determined at 
the indicated times. The average of two cultures is shown. (c) MEFs cultured in 3% or 20% 
oxygen were assayed for levels of p16, p19ARF and Î±-tubulin (control) by western blotting. 
3% oxygen cultures were analysed at early (PD2) and late (PD14 and PD24) passage. A
