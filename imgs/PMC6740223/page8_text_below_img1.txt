biological  fluids,  including  adult  peripheral  blood
and fetal blood [52, 53]. These cells show charac-
teristics  of  adherent-derived  MSCs  in  that  they
share a similar phenotypic profile (CD45-, CD42+,
SH2+, SH3+, SH4+) and have the capacity to differ-
entiate into a variety of mesenchymal tissues (i.e.,
bone,  cartilage  and  adipose)  both  in  vitro and  in
vivo [52-54].  These  results  suggest  that  in  vitro
derived MSCs might be able to survive and prolif-
erate  in  a  non-adherent  environment,  such  as  that
already demonstrated in a stirred suspension culture
system  [55].  The  suspension  cells  grown  under
these  non-contact  conditions  maintain  their  ability
to  form  functional  connective 
types.
Importantly,  this  approach  provides  an  alternative
strategy to expand adult bone marrow-derived non-
hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers in a scalable
and controllable bioprocess and also provides new
insight into, and possibilities to explore, mesenchy-
mal stem/progenitor cell biology.
