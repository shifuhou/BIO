Fig. 2 Schematic model depicting adult stem cell differentiation. Uncommitted MSCs undergo two stages, occur-
ring in the stem cell compartment and the committed cell compartment, prior to acquiring specific phenotypes. In the
stem cell compartment, multipotent MSCs give rise to a less potent cell population via asymmetric cell division (A),
which then generate more precursor cells with less self-renewal capacity and more restricted differentiation potential
via  symmetric  division  (S).  In  the  committed  cell  compartment,  these  tri-or  bi-potent  precursor  cells  continue  to
divide symmetrically and generate bi- or unipotent progenitor cells with pre-determined cell fate, which eventually
give rise to fully differentiated cells. Recent studies also suggest that the fully committed cells are able to dedifferen-
tiate into more potent cells, and acquire a different phenotype under inductive cues (open arrows).
