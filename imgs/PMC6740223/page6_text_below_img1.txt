Fig. 1 Models of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. (A) In this theoretical model, a mesenchymal stem cell
(MSC) has the capacity to differentiate into all connective tissue cell types, including bone, cartilage, tendon, mus-
cle,  marrow,  fat  and  dermis.  Furthermore,  MSCs  have  the  potential  for  self-renewal  and  proliferation  and,  under
defined environmental cues, can commit to a particular differentiation pathway. The lineage-committed cell progress-
es through several stages of maturation prior to the onset of terminal differentiation, which is marked by the cessa-
tion of proliferative capacity and shift toward synthesis of tissue-specific markers, including components of the extra-
cellular matrix. (B) An alternative model illustrating that in vivo, MSCs comprise a cell population that consists of
mesenchymal cells, which have different differentiation potentials (i.e., quadra-, tri-, bi and uni-potential). During in
vitro culture, all or a subset of these mesenchymal cells are isolated. During differentiation, the proliferative poten-
tial of these different mesenchymal cells decreases and, depending on the initial state of differentiation, both their pro-
liferative and multilineage potential become limited.
