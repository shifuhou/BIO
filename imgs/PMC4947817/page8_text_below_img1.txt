Figure 5 Enhancers of Tcf7 and Klf2 progressively acquire repressive H3K27me3 modifications. (A) Distribution of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3
modifications at putative enhancer regions (identified by enrichment of H3K4me1 marks in data set from ref. 31) of Tcf7 and Klf2 in the following
antigen-experienced CD81 T-cell subsets: naı¨ve (TN), stem cell memory (TSCM), central memory (TCM), and effector memory (TEM).
