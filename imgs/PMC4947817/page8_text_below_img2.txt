In the context of the present analysis, this would suggest a
pattern of chromatin remodeling of ‘closed-open-closed’ and
‘open-closed-open’ with regard to the permissivity of chromatin
at gene loci involved in effector function and memory, respect-
ively. Indeed, this has recently been proposed to explain other
epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylomes observed in
antigen-specific naı¨ve and effector CD81 T cells.17 Other devel-
opmental systems, however, do not seem to exhibit reversible
chromatin changes as cells mature through a lineage, but more
closely resemble a progressive change in chromatin as cells dif-
ferentiate from stem cells to progenitors and ultimately to mature
somatic cells.51–52 In other words, specification of cell fate seems
to be accompanied by a discrete transition from a uniquely
accessible epigenetic landscape to increasingly restrictive config-
urations.52 It may be that the adaptive immune system has
uniquely evolved to dynamically open and close its chromatin,
but this would seem to be exceptional as developmental specifica-
tion has typically been observed to progress from dynamic remo-
deling to generalized compaction of histone architecture.
