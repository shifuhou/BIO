HIF-1  regulates  the  balance  between  O2  supply  and  demand.  In 
well-oxygenated cells, prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins use 
O2 and α-ketoglutarate (αKG) to hydroxylate HIF-1α, which is then 
bound by VHL, ubiquitylated, and degraded by the proteasome. Under 
hypoxic conditions, the hydroxylation reaction is inhibited and HIF-1α 
accumulates and regulates cell proliferation directly or dimerizes with 
HIF-1β to activate the transcription of hundreds of target genes, many 
of which encode enzymes and transporters that control cell metabo-
lism. Red and blue arrows indicate reactions that are favored in aerobic 
and hypoxic conditions, respectively.
