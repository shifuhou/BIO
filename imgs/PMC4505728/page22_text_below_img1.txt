Figure 1. Two general classes of stem cell niche
A) The Drosophila male and female GSC niches are examples of the stromal niche. Non-
dividing stromal cells (green) hold the GSCs (dark pink) in place via adherens junctions 
(black boxes). GSCs contain a spectrosome (S) and a localized centrosome (*) that in the 
male is known to be the maternal centrosome. The GSC is surrounded by escort stem cells 
(ESC) or cyst progenitor stem cells (CPC) whose daughters (light blue) encyst the GSC 
daughter cell (pink). B) The Drosophila follicle cell stem cell (FSC) is an example an 
epidermal niche. The FSC is surrounded by FSC daugher cells (light blue), and also contacts 
the thin escort cells (light blue) that surround developing germline cysts (pink). The FSC 
does not contact any permanent stromal cells, but remains associated with a region of the 
basement membrane (thick black line). Intercellular signals are shown in yellow. The 
movement of cells is indicated by black arrows.
