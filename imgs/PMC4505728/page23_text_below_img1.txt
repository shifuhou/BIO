Figure 2. HSC niches
A) Adult HSCs reside primarily within bone marrow. Bone marrow is a complex organ 
containing many different hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. Bony trabeculae are 
found throughout the trabecular zone of bone, such that many cells in this region are close to 
bone surface. The interface of bone and bone marrow is known as the endosteum. Arteries 
carry oxygen, nutrients, and hematopoietic growth factors into the bone marrow, before 
feeding into venous circulation. Sinusoids are specialized venuoles that form a reticular 
network of fenestrated vessels that allow cells to pass in and out of circulation. B) A close
