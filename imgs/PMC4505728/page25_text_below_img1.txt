Figure 3. Two general classes of stem cell asymmetry
A) The preprogrammed differentiation of the first class of stem cell, that includes 
Drosophila GSCs, is only repressed by a local signal (red arrow) generated by nearby 
stromal cells. Daughter cells become derepressed by becoming displaced from the repressive 
signal within the niche and differentiate. Mammalian GSCs may use a related mechanism as 
they are preferentially found near (but not attached to) hormone-producing interstitial cells 
(Yoshida et al., 2007a). B) A second class of stem cell requires signals to differentiate, such 
as the Drosophila intestinal stem cell (ISC) pictured. ISCs divide asymmetrically such that 
only one daughter receives a (Notch) signal that specifies its fate (Ohlstein and Spradling, 
2007). Asymmetric partitioning of Notch activity also maintains Drosophila and mouse 
neural progenitors (Lee et al., 2006; Petersen et al., 2004).
