Figure 5 The morphology of TSCs and tenocytes in culture. A, B. PTSCs and ATSCs at passage 10 were in culture for at least 63 days,
respectively. These cells were cobblestone-like in a confluent culture. C. Morphology of tenocytes from the same rabbit patellar tendons; similar
morphology was observed in tenocytes from the Achilles tendons (not shown). These tenocytes were highly elongated in a confluent culture.
