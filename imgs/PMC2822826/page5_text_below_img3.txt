Figure 1 The colony formation of rabbit tendon stem cells (TSCs). A, B. Total PTSC and ATSC colonies stained with Methyl violet at 10 days.
C, D. Expanding colonies of PTSCs and ATSCs at 10 days, respectively. It is seen that more numerous and larger cell colonies were formed by
PTSCs compared to ATSCs. E. Quantitative analysis of colonies formed by PTSCs and ATSCs. Colony number of PTSCs was significantly different
from that of ATSCs (* p < 0.05). (Bars: 200 Î¼m).
