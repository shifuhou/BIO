Figure 4 The testing of multi-differentiation of rabbit TSCs in vivo. A. Formation of tendon-like tissue (TT) revealed by H&E staining and
immunohistochemical staining for collagen type I. The collagen fibers are parallel to each other (double arrow), indicative of formation of
tendon-like tissue (inset: collagen type I staining). B. Formation of fibrocartilage-like tissue (FT) (Alcian blue staining); and C. formation of bone-
like tissue (BT) (Alizarin Red S staining). (Bars: 50 Î¼m).
