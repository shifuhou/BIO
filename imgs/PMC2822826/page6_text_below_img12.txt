Figure 2 The testing of multi-differentiation potential of TSCs and tenocytes in vitro. A. Adipogenesis of PTSCs (arrows point to lipid
droplets). B. Chondrogenesis of PTSCs. C. Cartilage-like pellet (arrow) formed from PTSCs. D. Osteogenesis of PTSCs (An arrow points to a
clustered calcium droplet). Similar multi-differentiation potential is shown for ATSCs (E-H). Patellar tenocytes (PTs) and Achilles tenocytes (ATs)
were not found to exhibit such a multi-differentiation potential (I-P, also see text for additional descriptions of experimental results).
