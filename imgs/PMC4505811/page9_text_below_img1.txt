The level of hARD1 protein is stable during hypoxia. (A) RCC4 and HT1080 cells were 
exposed to either normoxia (N) or hypoxia (H) for 18 h and the cell lysates were analyzed 
by Western blotting with anti-hARD1. (B) As (A) using HeLa and HEK293 cells and CoCl2 
treatment for 6 h. (C) As (A) adding CoCl2 for the indicated times to MCF-7 cells.
