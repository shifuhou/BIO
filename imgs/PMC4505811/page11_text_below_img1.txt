hARD1 interacts with HIF-1α. (A) MCF-7 cells were cotransfected by plasmids encoding 
HA-HIF-1α and Xp-hARD1 (or Xp-lacZ as a negative control). Immunoprecipitates of the 
cell lysates using anti-Xp were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA to detect HA-
HIF-1α. (B) GST (negative control) or GST-ODD beads were incubated with NusA-hARD1 
or NusA-ABD (negative control). After washing steps, the beads were analyzed by SDS–
PAGE and Coomassie staining to determine the level of retained NusA-hARD1/ABD. (C) 
As (B) using pure hARD1 and analysis by Western blotting and anti-hARD1.
