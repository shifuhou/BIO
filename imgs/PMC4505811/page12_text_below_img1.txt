hARD1 does not acetylate HIF-1α. (A) Interaction assay as Fig. 3C using GST, GST-ODD 
WT or GST-ODD K532R beads and acetylation buffer with indicated concentrations of 
Acetyl Coenzyme A (AcCoA). hARD1 retained on beads after washing was analyzed by 
SDS–PAGE and Western blotting with anti-hARD1. (B) Acetylation assay with GST-ODD 
and purified hARD1. Detection of acetylated GST-ODD by Western blotting and anti-acetyl 
lysine and by incorporation of [14-C] acetyl coenzyme A. Coomassie staining verifies equal 
loading of GST-ODD. Upper panel: Demonstration of hARD1 activity in ACTH 
(adrenocorticotropin 1–24) N-α-acetylation assay. (C) As (B), but with immunoprecipitated 
NATH–hARD1 complexes as enzyme. HeLa cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) 
with anti-NATH, anti-hARD1 or rabbit immunoglobulins (Ig) as a negative control.
