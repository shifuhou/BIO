Figure 4. Induction of MYC in hypoxic culture. A) The expression of MYC in the exon-array data. Fold change (FC) compared to normoxic
culture, *** = p,0.005. B) RT-PCR validation of the MYC expression in hESCs, *** = p,0.001. Data from two replicate cultures of hESC line H9. C)
Western blot analysis of MYC, pMYC-Ser62 and HIF1a in hESC line HS360. D) Western blot analysis of HIF1a, HIF2a, MYC and pMYC-Ser62 in hESC lines
H7 and H9 (individual experiments). E) Western blot analysis of HIF2a and MYC in hypoxia (4%) and F) in chemically induced (CoCl2) hypoxic
conditions in embryocarcinoma cell line 2102Ep. G) Transcripts identified to change in response in to hypoxia in hESCs (exon array data) and reported
to have MYC binding site in hESCs [23]. * = transcripts shared with the data presented on Figure 3C. H) Western blot analysis of HIF1a, HIF2a and MYC
after small interfering (si) silencing (NT = negative control siRNA). Cells treated 48 h with siRNA before exposure to hypoxia for 2 h.
