The comparison of the proportions of human CD45+ cells in BM cells
of NOD/SCID mouse recipients transplanted with fresh CB CD34+
cells from 12 different samples and their progenies cultured with
SCF+FL+TPO+IL-6/sIL-6R. NOD/SCID mice were injected with 1 ·
104 to 2 · 104 fresh CB CD34+ and their progenies, and the propor-
tions of human CD45+ cells in recipient BM cells were analyzed by
flow cytometry 10–12 weeks after the transplantation. The percent-
ages of CD45+ cells in BM cells of the recipients transplanted with
the cultured cells were higher than those with fresh CB CD34+ cells
(P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). EX, experiment.
