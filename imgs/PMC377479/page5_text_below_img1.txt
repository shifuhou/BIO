The repopulating ability of fresh CB CD34+ cells and the cells cul-
tured with SCF+FL, SCF+FL+TPO, and SCF+FL+TPO+IL-6/sIL-6R. A
total of 2 Â· 104 CB CD34+ cells and their progenies were transplant-
ed into NOD/SCID mice, and the proportion of human CD45+ cells
in recipient BM cells was analyzed by flow cytometry 12 weeks after
the transplantation.
