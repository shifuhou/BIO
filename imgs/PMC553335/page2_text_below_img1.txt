Fig. 1. Proliferation indices of human lymphocytes stimulated with CD3(cid:1)
CD28 crosslinking and Con A are higher at 20% oxygen. Human PBMC stained
with CFDA-SE were cultured at 5%, 10%, and 20% oxygen for 5 days (see
Materials and Methods). Shown are lymphocytes stimulated by CD3(cid:1)CD28
crosslinking (Upper) and with Con A (20 (cid:1)g(cid:1)ml, Lower). Statistics were calcu-
lated by using JMP software by least-square-Ô¨Åt model with sample and oxygen
as independent variables (see Materials and Methods). Each set of connected
points represents one subject (n (cid:1) 8).
