Increase in total number of CD4 and CD8 T cells stimulated with
CD3(cid:1)CD28 crosslinking and Con A is higher at 20% oxygen. Human PBMC
stained with CFDA-SE were stimulated at 5%, 10%, and 20% oxygen for 5 days
(see Materials and Methods). Shown are cells stimulated with CD3(cid:1)CD28
crosslinking (Top), cells stimulated with Con A (20 (cid:1)g(cid:1)ml, Middle), and un-
stimulated cells (Bottom). Cell counts were performed by using BD Trucount
beads (see Materials and Methods). Fold change is calculated for each subject
for CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets as the ratio of the number of live cells in the
subset at day 5 to the number of live cells in the subset at the beginning of the
culture. Statistics were calculated using JMP software by least-square-Ô¨Åt model
with sample and oxygen as independent variables (see Materials and Meth-
ods). Each set of connected points represents one subject (n (cid:1) 6). The numbers
of live CD4 and CD8 T cells present in unstimulated cultures decreased 0.3-fold
on average by the end of the culture period (e.g., CD4 T cells for a typical
subject decreased from 3.6 (cid:4) 105 cells at the start to 2.6 (cid:4) 105 cells at the end
of the culture period). This decrease was independent of the incubator oxygen
tension (P (cid:5) 0.05).
