Figure 4. Schematic mechanisms of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cardiac regeneration.
Angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and cardiomyocytes diﬀerentiation capacities of MSCs make them
possible for cardiac repair. Moreover, the paracrine eﬀects of MSCs provide diﬀerent kinds of growth
and anti-inﬂammatory factors for the immunoregulation after ischemia of heart [139].
