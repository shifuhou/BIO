PIM adducts in vivo in bone marrow SP cells. Mice were injected with
saline or 120 mg/kg PIM (n (cid:4) 5), and after 3 h, bone marrow samples were
collected and subjected to Ho staining in vitro to isolate SP cells. Representa-
tive PIM staining of SP and non-SP cells in the bone marrow is shown. Three
different regions of bone marrow cells based on Ho dye efﬂux, non-SP (R1),
top SP (R2), and bottom SP (R3) were sorted. The sorted cells were analyzed for
PIM binding by using ﬂow cytometry (A) as well as immunoﬂuorescence
microscopy (B). (A) For ﬂow cytometric analysis of PIM binding, the sorted cells
were ﬁxed and intracellularly stained by using anti-PIM primary antibody and
a goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab(cid:5))2 Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody. Similar
positive staining of SP cells were obtained in two other separate experiments,
