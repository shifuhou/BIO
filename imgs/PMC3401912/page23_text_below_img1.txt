Figure 1. HIF1α and HIF2α exhibit antagonistic functions in nitric oxide (NO) production
Under low IFNy conditions, HIF2α is more abundant and induces arginase1 expression,
resulting in NO production. Under high IFNy conditions, HIF2α is diminished and HIF1α
dominates so that iNOS can utilize arginine for NO generation. These physiologically
antagonistic functions allow the HIFα subunits to coordinately regulate NO production in a
cytokine-induced and transcription-dependent fashion.
