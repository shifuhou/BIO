Figure 3. Differential regulation of HIF1α and HIF2α by SIRT1
(A) High levels of NAD+ inactivate SIRT1, resulting in decreased HIF1α transcriptional
activity and enhanced HIF2α stimulation of target genes like erythropoietin. (8) Distinct
effects of HIF1α and HIF2α on MYC complex formation and promoter occupancy.
Hypoxic cells exclusively expressing HIF1α exhibit decreased MYC activity due to
diminished association with MAX and SP1, as well as reduced MYC stability. HIF1α also
induces MXI1 expression, which inhibits MYC target gene expression (see text for details).
Cells expressing HIF2α exhibit increased MYC complex formation and target gene
activation, although the mechanisms involved are not fully understood.
