Figure 2. HIF1α and HIF2α are post-translationally modified, and differentially regulated by
multiple mechanisms
(A) Multiple mechanisms differentially regulate HIF1α and HIF2α at the levels of
transcription or mRNA stability (red), mRNA translation (green), and protein stability
(blue). In most cases, these regulatory events have opposite effects on HIF1α and HIF2α
expression, or appear to be specific for only one HIFα isoform. See text for details. (NE), no
effect. (8) Summary of phosphorylations, acetylations, and hydroxylations of the two HIFα
subunits by CK1, ARD1, PHDs, FIH, MAPK, SIRT1, PKD1, and ATM. It should be noted
that ARD1 acetylates HIF1α, while SIRT1 deacetylates both HIF1α and HIF2α. (C)
Sequence alignment of HIF2α residues 301-331 with a similar region of HIF1α; shaded
residues are unique to HIF2α and allow the selective phosphorylation of HIF2α T324 by
PKD1.
