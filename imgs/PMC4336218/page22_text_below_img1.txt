a,b, Colony formation assay using ESC-1 cells. Cells were plated at clonal density and 
media changed to experimental media containing either DM-αKG or DM-succinate on day 2 
and then analyzed 4 days later by alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining and scored for number 
of differentiated, mixed and undifferentiated colonies. a, Representative brightfield images 
of AP-stained colonies. b, Quantification of colonies. DM-αKG has more undifferentiated 
colonies than vehicle or DM-succinate treated wells, ***, p < 0.0001, calculated by 2-way 
ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-test. c, Mean GFP intensity of Nanog-
GFP cells treated for three days with or without DM-αKG. Data are presented as the mean ± 
s.e.m. (b) or 95% confidence intervals (c) of triplicate wells from a representative 
experiment.
