Extended Data Figure 2. mESCs cultured with 2i demonstrate altered glucose and glutamine 
utilization
a, 2i enables glutamate synthesis from glucose-derived carbons. ESC-1 cells cultured in S/L, 
S/L/2i or 2i/L medium were incubated with medium containing [U-13C]glucose for four 
hours and the fraction of glutamate containing glucose-derived carbons is shown. b, ESC-1 
cells were cultured for four hours in glutamine-free S/L or 2i/L medium containing 
[U-13C]glucose and the total amount of glutamate labeled by glucose-derived carbons is 
shown. c, Incorporation of 14C derived from [U-14C]glucose (14C-glc) (left) or derived from 
[U-14C]glutamine (14C-gln) (right) into total cellular protein after 48 hour incubations. p < 
0.05 for 14C-glc, p = 0.1 for 14C-gln, calculated by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Data 
are presented as the mean ± s.d of triplicate wells (a,b) or ± s.e.m of quadruplicate wells (c) 
from a representative experiment.
