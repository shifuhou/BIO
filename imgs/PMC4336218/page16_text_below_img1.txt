Extended Data Fig. 6. αKG increases Nanog expression
a, Representative histogram of GFP intensity of Nanog-GFP cells treated with or without 
DM-αKG for three days. Grey represents background staining. b, ESC-1 cells were cultured 
in S/L medium with DM-αKG for four passages and then switched to medium containing 
the indicated amounts of DM-αKG (0.5 – 4 mM) or vehicle control (S/L) for three days. 
GFP expression (mean fluorescence intensity, M.F.I.) was determined by FACS. Data are 
presented as the mean ± s.d. of triplicate wells from a representative experiment.
