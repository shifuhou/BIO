Extended Data Figure 4. Generation of JMJD3 mutant cells
a, Schematic of targeting strategy for gRNAs to mouse Jmjd3 exon 17. gRNA sequences are 
highlighted in blue. b. Representative sequences from two clones used in this study. Sanger 
sequencing revealed indels as shown in schematic. Red dashes, deleted bases; red bases, 
insertions. gRNA is highlighted in blue and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences 
identified in green. Predicted cut site indicated by red triangle. Location of in-frame 
downstream stop is indicated on the right. c, An example chromatogram for clone 
JMJD3Δ/Δ-2 showing single base-pair insertions at predicted Cas9 cleavage site.
