Extended Data Figure 5. αKG increases Tet activity in mESCs
a, Simplified schematic of the reaction mechanism of TET1/2 enzymes. b, Relative percent 
5-methylcytosine (% 5-mC) in ESC-1 cells cultured in S/L medium with or without DM-
αKG for 24 hours. Each data point represents a sample from triplicate wells of a 
representative experiment. c, Gene expression in ESC-1 cells cultured with DM-αKG or 
DM-succinate for three days. d, Gene expression in ESC-1 cells cultured in S/L medium 
with or without DM-αKG for four passages. e, Gene expression in wild-type or Tet1/Tet2 
double knock out (KO) mESCs cultured with DM-αKG or DM-succinate for 72 hours. qRT-
PCR data (c–e) was normalized to Actin or Gapdh and samples were normalized to the 
control group. Oct3/4 is not expected to change and is included as a control. Data are 
presented as the mean ± s.e.m. of triplicate wells.
