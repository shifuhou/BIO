FIG. 6. EPO 3'-FS functions as a hypoxia-inducible enhancer in
Hep3B cells. Plasmids contained the SV40 basal promoter fused to
CAT coding sequence and, 3' to the transcription unit, either no
additional DNA (pSVcat), 256 bp (pSVcatEPO-1) or 2.5 kb (pSV-
catEPO-2) of EPO gene 3'-FS in the sense (S) or antisense (A)
transcriptional orientation, or the 236-bp SV40 enhancer (pSV-
catSV). (Upper) CAT expression in transfected Hep3B cells cultured
in 1% (shaded bars) or 20%o (open bars) 02- IND, inducibility (1%
02/20%o 02)- (Lower) CAT expression in transfected Hep3B cells
cultured in the presence (shaded bars) or absence (open bars) of
CoCI2. IND, inducibility (+ CoCI2/- CoCI2).
