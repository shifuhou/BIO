FIG. 2. DNase I footprint analysis of EPO gene 3'-flanking-region
probe incubated with liver nuclear extracts. A 256-bp region was
amplified by PCR with a 5' end-labeled forward primer and used as
a probe. Sequence ladders (lanes 1-4 and 13-16) represent dideoxy
reactions (A, C, G, T) using the same labeled primer as in PCR. Probe
was incubated with no extract (0; lanes 5 and 6) or with liver nuclear
extract from nonanemic mice (L1; lanes 7-9) or anemic mice (L2;
lanes 10-12) and digested with 0 (-; lane 5) or 0.3 ,.g (+; lanes 6-12)
of DNase I. Full-length probe is at the top of each lane; smaller
fragments seen in lane 5 and across gel represent either probe
degradation or extraneous PCR products. Incubation of probe with
Li and L2 was performed in triplicate. HS, hypersensitive sites
formed upon incubation of probe with Li prior to digestion. A-D,
regions protected from DNase I digestion after incubation of probe
with Li or L2.
