FIG. 1. Human EPO gene 3' flanking region is hypersensitive to
DNase I digestion in liver nuclei of transgenic mice. Nuclei were
isolated from liver and kidney of mice carrying six tandem copies
(two of which are shown) of a 10-kb BamHI (B)-EcoRI (R) human
genomic fragment containing the EPO gene (hatched box). Nuclei
were treated with indicated amounts ofDNase I (in ,ug/ml), and DNA
was extracted and digested with Bgl II (Bg), as was DNA from a tail
biopsy specimen (T). A 4.4-kb restriction fragment (horizontal ar-
rows) was detected by the probe (dark box). Vertical arrow, location
of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS) in liver nuclei.
