Figure 1. Oxygen tensions in stem cell microenvironments
Embryonic stem cells and adult bone marrow-derived stem cells reside in low oxygen
environments. (A) Embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of early stage
blastocytsts and maintain a totipotent state that forms ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm.
The intrauterine environment in which the embryonic stem cells growth and development occur
has an oxygen tension ranging from 1–5% through the first trimester. (B) Oxygen tension in
bone marrow is well below ambient oxygen environment in the range of 3–7% O2 with oxygen
concentrations decreasing with distance away from sinuses. Recent in vivo studies provided
direct experimental evidence that HSCs are distributed predominantly at the lowest end of an
oxygen gradient within the bone marrow and away from sinuses.
