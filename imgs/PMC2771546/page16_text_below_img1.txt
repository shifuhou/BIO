Figure 3. Learning from nature: The influence of oxygen tension during bone-cartilage tissue
formation
In vivo: During development, cartilage forms via the processes of mesenchymal condensation
and carefully regulated chondrogenic differentiation in very hypoxic environments. Long bone
formation occurs via endochondral ossification where hypertrophic chondrocytes upregulate
angiogenic genes triggering vascular invasion (with consequent increases in oxygen tension)
followed by new bone formation (green rectangles). Images adapted from Ref. 89, with
permission from Nature Publishing Group. In vitro: Hypoxia enables the expansion of stem
cells while maintaining their undifferentiated states. Cells are then seeded into 3D
organizations to facilitate functional tissue development. Chondrogenic differentiation is
enhanced under hypoxic conditions relative to 20% O2. Differentiation into osteogenic lineage
and subsequent bone formation (green rectangles) in vitro is optimized at ambient (20%) O2
tensions and inhibited under hypoxic conditions.
