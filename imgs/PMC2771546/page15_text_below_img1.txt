Figure 2. Effect of hypoxia on in vitro stem cell phenotype
(A and B) Human ESCs (H1) cultured on MEF feeder layers under normoxic (21% O2) and
hypoxic (5% O2) conditions. Normoxic cells display extensive regions of differentiation (dark
circles surrounded by bright rings) compared with hypoxic cultures. (C and D) Further
comparison of H1 hESCs grown at 21% O2 and 3% O2, respectively, showing fewer
differentiated (darker, nonuniform) regions under hypoxic conditions. Images adapted from
Ref. 50, with permission from National Academy of Sciences. (Eâ€“H) Comparisons of bone
marrow-derived hMSCs grown under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (2% O2) conditions: (E
and F) Significantly higher connexin-43 expression is observed in hypoxic hMSCs grown in
monolayer culture for 11 days using expansion medium. (G and H) Phase contrast images
demonstrate the maintenance of uniform spindle morphology at late stages of passage under
hypoxic conditions. Images adapted from Ref. 61, with permission from Academic Press.
