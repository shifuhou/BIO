Figure 2. HIFα Control of Cell Metabolism
HIFs modulate cellular metabolism to faciliate cellular adaptation to low oxygen
environments. Glucose consumption and glycolysis are promoted primarily by HIF1α, while
fatty acid storage is promoted by HIF2α. Both factors inhibit mitochondrial consumption
and oxidation of carbon, leading to a decreased production of ATP through oxidative
phosphorylation and less reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a by-product. Instead, glycolysis
makes a larger contribution to ATP synthesis in the cell. HIF2α, furthermore, inhibits ROS
production through SOD2 and other targets.
