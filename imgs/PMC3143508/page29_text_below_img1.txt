Figure 3. Effects of HIF on multiple steps of cancer development
HIF is stabilized by hypoxia and other nonhypoxic stimuli in many cancers. HIF activity in
cancer has been associated with 1. putative cancer ‘stem’ cell maintenance and increased
expression of genes involved in 2. proliferation and survival, 3. metabolism, 4. angiogenesis,
5. recruitment of infiltrating cells such as tumor-associated macrophages and bone marrow-
derived cells, and 6. tumor cell metastasis. Some examples of HIF regulated genes and
oncogenic pathways are given in parentheses.
