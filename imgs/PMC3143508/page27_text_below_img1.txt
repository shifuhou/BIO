Figure 1. Regulation and function of hypoxia inducible factor-α (HIFα) subunits
In the presence of oxygen and α-ketoglutarate, HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing
enzymes (PHDs) and Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH1) hydroxylate and inactivate HIFα. PHD
and FIH1 activity are inhibited by hypoxia and certain intracellular metabolites, including
reactive oxygen species, fumarate, succinate, and potentially 2-hydroxyglutarate, resulting in
HIFα stabilization. HIFα expression and/or activity is also regulated post-translationally by
sirtuins and intermittent hypoxia. HIFα stabilization results in the activation of a
transcriptional program with effects on metabolism, redox homoeostasis, vascular
remodeling, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and other processes.
