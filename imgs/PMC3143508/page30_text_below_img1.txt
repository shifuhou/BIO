Figure 4. Macrophage and vascular responses to HIF
A, NFκB dependent regulation of HIF in macrophages. In addition to direct HIF
stabilization, hypoxic inhibition of PHDs result in IKK-mediated degradation of the NFκB
inhibitor IκB. Activated NFκB directly transactivates HIF1α. B, HIF activity is involved in
multiple aspects of macrophage behavior via the induction of genes involved in 1. bacterial
killing (NOS2, CRAMP), 2. migration and invasion (CXCR4, FN1, MCSFR), 3. cytokine
production (IL1β, IL6, IL12, TNFα), and 4. metabolism (GLUT1, PGK1). C, HIF1α
stabilization in endothelial cells increase 1. VEGF expression, 2. migration, and 3.
proliferation, whereas HIF2α stabilization promotes 4. endothelial cell adhesion to the
extracellular matrix.
