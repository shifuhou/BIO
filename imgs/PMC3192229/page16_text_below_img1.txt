a, TCR excision circle (TREC) copy number in sorted CD8+ T-cell subsets relative to TN 
cells. Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m. of 4 donors. b, Intracellular cytokine staining of 
PBMC from a representative healthy donor after stimulation with SEB. Graphs show naïve-
like (NL) gated T cells. NL, CD45RO−CCR7+CD45RA+CD27+CD28+. Numbers represent 
the percentage of CD95+ (TSCM) and CD95− (TN) cells producing a single cytokine. c, 
Percentages of CD8+ T-cell subsets producing IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α in 6 healthy donors 
(obtained as described in panel b). d, Pie charts depicting the quality of the cytokine
