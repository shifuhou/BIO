Figure 2. miR-34a mediates hypoxia-induced EMT in HK-2 cells. (A) Immunofluorescence analysis of Zo-1, E-cadherin, a-SMA and vimentin
expression in anti-miR-34a and anti-miRNA control transfected HK2 cells. (B) Western blot analysis of Zo-1, E-cadherin, a-SMA and vimentin expression
in anti-miR-34a and anti-miRNA control transfected HK2 cells. A representative blot from three independent experiments is shown (left). The
histogram shows the average volume density normalized to the loading control, b-actin (right). (C) Western blot analysis of Zo-1, E-cadherin, a-SMA
and vimentin expression in parental cells, miR-34a and miRNA control transfected cells after 48 hours under hypoxic conditions. A representative blot
from three independent experiments is shown (left). The histogram shows the average volume density normalized to the loading control, b-actin
(right). *p,0.01 compared with the parental cells and control cells.
