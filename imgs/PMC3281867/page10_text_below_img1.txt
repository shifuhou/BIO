Figure 6. Expression of miR-34a in renal tissue from patients with CKD. (A) Expression analysis of miR-34a in renal tissue from patients with
DN, IgA nephropathy (IgAN) by real-time PCR. Shown are relative expression values normalized to U6. Pretransplant biopsies from living donor
kidneys (LD) were used as control. *P,0.01. (B) Expression of E-cadherin and Snail in renal tissue from living donor (LD) kidneys and patients with IgA
nephropathy (IgAN) by IHC (original magnification, 4006). (C) Scatter plot with fitted values intervals for tubular expression of miR-34a and E-
cadherin (upper) or Snail (lower).
