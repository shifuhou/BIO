Induction  of apoptosis by ligation of Fas (CD95) on Jurkat 
cells. (A) Cells were cultured in either medium alone or medium contain- 
ing 250  ng/rnl  of anti-Fas IgM for 7 h and viewed under phase contrast 
microscopy. The scale bar is in arbitrary units. (B) Detection of internu- 
cleosomal DNA  fragmentation in Jurkat  cells treated with  the  indicated 
concentrations ofanti-Fas  IgM for 7 h.  (C) Cell death, as assessed by pro- 
pidium iodide uptake, after a 24-h  exposure to the indicated concentra- 
tions of anti-Fas IgM. Each data point was  derived from  an  analysis of 
10,000 cells from a representative experiment.
