Mir-210 is broadly expressed and is a HIF1α-specific gene. A) Up-regulation of mir-210 by
hypoxia is detected in all six different tumor types examined. Each cell line was split into two
identical plates 24 hours prior to treatment. One was exposed to 2% O2 for 24 hours while the
other was kept under normoxia and then, RNAs were harvested at the same time and used for
Northern blotting. RCC4/VHL and 786/VHL are RCC4 and 786-O cell lines with stably
reconstituted wild-type VHL gene. mir-210 is well induced by hypoxia in almost all cell lines
examined, with highest induction in HSC3, MCF10A, and MCF7 cells. However, up-
regulation by hypoxia is barely seen in MDA231, SQB20, and 786-O cells. U6 RNA was used
as a loading control; B) Western blot of HIF1α and HIF2α in MDA-MB-231 and paired RCC4,
