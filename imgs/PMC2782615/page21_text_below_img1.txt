Mir-210 represses tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. A) FaDu cells with ectopic
expression of mir-210 and parental cells were injected s.c in nude mice at a density of 106 cells.
N=6 for parental group and N=7 for 210E group. B) SU86.86 cells with ectopic expression of
mir-210 and parental cells were injected s.c in nude mice at a density of 107 cells. N=5 for the
each group. Tumor volumes are represented as average ± SEM. C) Tumor growth in the first
four weeks of FaDu cell xenograft implants. D) Tumor growth in the first seven weeks of
SU86.86 cell xenograft implants. Left panel, cells without ectopic mir-210 expression; right
panel, cells with ectopic mir-210 expression. E) Expression of mir-210 was measured by
TaqMan RT-PCR from xenograft tumor samples with/without ectopic expression of mir-210.
Expression of mir-210 was also measured from the same tumor cells left after tumor injection.
RNA input was normalized on small nuclear RNA RNU48. There is a significant difference
of mir-210 expression between the parental and 210E groups (student’s t-test, p=0.025). F)
