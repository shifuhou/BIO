Identification of mir-210 target genes by miRNP-IP. A) A schematic view of the strategy to
identify mir-210 targets. B) Venn diagram shows potential mir-210 target genes predicted by
four computational programs, TargetSacn, PicTar, miRanda, and PITA and genes enriched in
miRNP-IP experiments. C) Fifty potential mir-210 target genes were identified. The four genes
used in validation were highlighted in gray. The FGFRL1 gene with a little less than 2-fold
enrichment in array 2 was also included at the bottom of the list. The values shown are
normalized log2(R/G).
