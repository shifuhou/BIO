Identification of the functional HRE in mir-210 promoter. A) The schematic view of mir-210
genomic structure. The location of the cloned promoter related to mir-210 coding region was
shown in top panel. Open box indicates the coding region of mir-210 and solid line indicates
the 2.3kb promoter cloned. The conservation of mir-210 genomic sequences across species
was shown in the bottom panel, which is from the UCSC database (http://genome.ucsc.edu).
B) mir-210 promoter analysis. Promoter fragments were cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector;
a 5XHRE construct, including five copies of the human VEGF HRE, serves as a positive
control. Serial deletion constructs (identified by the letters Aâ€“H in the middle of the figure)
are schematically represented in the bar diagram on the left, while their relative promoter
activities in normoxia (gray bars) and 2% oxygen (black bars) are displayed on the right of the
figure. The small black bars on the top represent the relative location of the ten potential HREs.
The arrow at the top of the bar diagram indicates this HRE is essential for up-regulation of
promoter activity under hypoxia. The open box represents mir-210 coding sequence; C)
