Figure 2. Hypoxia Pathway and Innate Immunity
(A) Inflammation. HIF-1α and NF-κB crosstalk regulates essential inflammatory functions 
in myeloid cells. HIF-1α increases macrophage aggregation, invasion, and motility and 
drives the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. HIF-1α also increases neutrophil 
survival by inhibiting apoptosis and triggers NF-κB-dependent neutrophilic inflammation. 
(B) Infection. HIF-1α increases intracellular bacterial killing by macrophages and also 
promotes granule protease production and release of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α, which in 
turn further contribute in antimicrobial control. (C) Cancer. As a result of hypoxia, HIF-1α 
is stabilized in cancer cells, increasing the production of chemotactic factors like CCL5, 
CXCL12, VEGF, endothelins ET-1 and ET-2, and semaphorin3A (Sema3A), which result in 
myeloid cell recruitment to the tumor. Once located in 31 hypoxic regions, tumor-associated 
macrophages stabilize HIF-1α, which contributes to tumor-promoting inflammation, 
angiogenesis, and impaired lymphocyte function. (D) Metabolism. HIF-1α in myeloid cells 
increases the transcription of key glycolytic enzymes, resulting on increased glucose uptake 
and glycolytic rate. Importantly, pyruvate entry in the citric acid cycle (TCA) is inhibited 
and converted to lactate, which is released to the extracellular compartment. This metabolic 
adaptation results in a decreased O2 consumption by limiting the rate of oxidative 
phosphorylation (OXPHOS). M1 and M2 polarized macrophages show different metabolic 
pathway preferences: whereas M1 rely on glycolysis as energy source, M2 have steady 
OXPHOS metabolism.
