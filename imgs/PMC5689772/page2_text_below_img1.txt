Figure 1. Registered clinical trials (2009–2016) employing human umbilical cord MSCs numbered a total of 109 as of January 2016, based
on Clinicaltrials.gov data, although only 34 are currently open. The pie-chart shows the broad distribution of target indications (excluding
those from cord blood). Although “Haematological” indications are the largest group at 12%, the majority of trials rely on the immune modu-
latory and anti-inﬂammatory properties of the cells, rather than a capacity for connective tissue lineage differentiation. These percentages
differ from MSC trials employing cells from all tissue sources, where “Neuro-degenerative” and “Liver” targets represent 60% of the total
number of clinical trials. Abbreviation: MSC, mesenchymal stromal cells.
