Figure 4. Comparative anatomy of the umbilical cord. (A, B): Por-
cine, (C-E): Equine, (F): Canine. (A): Unlike the human cord, the peri-
vascular zones are not clearly demarcated in the porcine cord. (B):
In the porcine cord, Wharton’s jelly contains many small vascular
structures. (C): The equine cord has four major vessels and many
co-lateral and branching vessels. (D): Each of the main vessels has a
well-developed tunica adventitia as seen in this dissected specimen.
(E): The tunica adventitia is distinct from the tunica media in this
H&E stained cross-section. (F): Like the equine cord, the canine cord
has multiple vessels with co-lateral branching. The vessels are con-
tained within the amniotic epithelium but, unlike the human, por-
cine and equine cords, does not from a ﬁrm roughly circular but
rather a diffuse and ﬂattened structure. [Image courtesy of Dr. Emily
