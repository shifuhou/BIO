Figure 3. CD146 labeling of a ﬁrst trimester cord (A) and a term cord (B) counterstained with DAPI. In the ﬁrst trimester, the smooth muscle
vessel wall labels positively, but the surrounding tissue is negative for CD146. On the contrary, at term the vascular endothelium is now highly
positive, the vessel wall is still positive, but so also are cells in the perivascular tissue. Scale Bars A, B 5 100 mm.
