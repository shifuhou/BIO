Figure 5. Due to the high CFU-F frequency, Sarugaser et al. under-
took differentiation assays on both parent and daughter single cell
derived clonal populations. Various self-renewing mesenchymal stro-
mal cells types were identiﬁed resulting in the hierarchy show here.
The semicircular arrows represent populations that are self-
renewing. The default lineage is the ﬁbroblast. Thus, some stem cells
self-renew and parents and daughters both display ﬁve-lineage dif-
ferentiation while others are capable of only 4, 3, or 2 lineage differ-
entiation. A self-renewing
identiﬁed.
