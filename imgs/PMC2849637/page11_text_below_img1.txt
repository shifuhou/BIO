Metabolic pathways active in proliferating cells are directly controlled by signaling pathways
involving known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. This schematic shows our current
understanding of how glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate pathway,
and glutamine metabolism are interconnected in proliferating cells. This metabolic wiring
allows for both NADPH production and acetyl-CoA flux to the cytosol for lipid synthesis. Key
steps in these metabolic pathways can be influenced by signaling pathways known to be
important for cell proliferation. Activation of growth factor receptors leads to both tyrosine
kinase signaling and PI3K activation. Via AKT, PI3K activation stimulates glucose uptake and
flux through the early part of glycolysis. Tyrosine kinase signaling negatively regulates flux
through the late steps of glycolysis, making glycolytic intermediates available for
macromolecular synthesis as well as supporting NADPH production. Myc drives glutamine
metabolism, which also supports NADPH production. LKB1/AMPK signaling and p53
decrease metabolic flux through glycolysis in response to cell stress. Decreased glycolytic flux
in response to LKB/AMPK or p53 may be an adaptive response to shut off proliferative
metabolism during periods of low energy availability or oxidative stress. Tumor suppressors
are shown in red, and oncogenes are in green. Key metabolic pathways are labeled in purple
with white boxes, and the enzymes controlling critical steps in these pathways are shown in
blue. Some of these enzymes are candidates as novel therapeutic targets in cancer. Malic
enzyme refers to NADP+-specific malate dehydrogenase [systematic name (S)-
malate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating)].
