Microbes and cells from multicellular organisms have similar metabolic phenotypes under
similar environmental conditions. Unicellular organisms undergoing exponential growth often
grow by fermentation of glucose into a small organic molecule such as ethanol. These
organisms, and proliferating cells in a multicellular organism, both metabolize glucose
primarily through glycolysis, excreting large amounts of carbon in the form of ethanol, lactate,
or another organic acid such as acetate or butyrate. Unicellular organisms starved of nutrients
rely primarily on oxidative metabolism, as do cells in a multicellular organism that are not
stimulated to proliferate. This evolutionary conservation suggests that there is an advantage to
oxidative metabolism during nutrient limitation and nonoxidative metabolism during cell
proliferation.
