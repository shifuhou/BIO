Fig. 2.
Schematic representation of the differences between oxidative phosphorylation, anaerobic
glycolysis, and aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). In the presence of oxygen,
nonproliferating (differentiated) tissues first metabolize glucose to pyruvate via glycolysis and
then completely oxidize most of that pyruvate in the mitochondria to CO2 during the process
of oxidative phosphorylation. Because oxygen is required as the final electron acceptor to
completely oxidize the glucose, oxygen is essential for this process. When oxygen is limiting,
cells can redirect the pyruvate generated by glycolysis away from mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation by generating lactate (anaerobic glycolysis). This generation of lactate during
anaerobic glycolysis allows glycolysis to continue (by cycling NADH back to NAD+), but
results in minimal ATP production when compared with oxidative phosphorylation. Warburg
observed that cancer cells tend to convert most glucose to lactate regardless of whether oxygen
is present (aerobic glycolysis). This property is shared by normal proliferative tissues.
Mitochondria remain functional and some oxidative phosphorylation continues in both cancer
cells and normal proliferating cells. Nevertheless, aerobic glycolysis is less efficient than
oxidative phosphorylation for generating ATP. In proliferating cells, ~10% of the glucose is
diverted into biosynthetic pathways upstream of pyruvate production.
