between  cells  and  the  surrounding  extracellular  matrix.  CAMs
belong to different protein families, including integrins, cadherins,
selectins, addresins and immunoglobulin-like cell molecules [87]
and  their  expression  is  restricted  to  specific  cell  types.  Besides
playing a key homeostatic role in maintaining the architecture of
quiescent tissues, CAMs have also to adapt to the microenviron-
mental changes that occur during some physiological and patho-
logical processes [88]. We have previously shown that endothelial
CAMs  are  modulated  by  nitric  oxide  [89]  whose  production  is
dependent on oxygen pressure. To visualize the direct impact of
oxygen tension on the cell surface phenotype of endothelial cells,
we studied intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM) and vascular
cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) which are involved in inflamma-
tory  processes:  ICAM-1/CD54,  ICAM-2/CD102  and  VCAM-
1/CD106. As shown in Figure 7, ICAM-1/CD54 expression is sta-
ble whatever was the oxygen level. But skin physioxia (26.6 mmHg
or  3.5%  O2)  decreases  VCAM-1/CD106  whereas  only  hypoxia
(less than 7.6 mmHg or 1% O2) is able to inhibit ICAM-2/CD102.
