Fig. 2 Principles of PET. 18F radiotracer is intra-
venously  injected.  The  tracer  decays  by  emit-
ting a positron, which annihilates with a nearby
electron to produce two (cid:4)-rays. The PET scan-
ner  can  detect  the  coincident  (cid:4)-rays,  and
images can be reconstructed showing the loca-
tion(s) and concentration of the tracer of inter-
est.  Sectional  PET  image  is  shown:  normal
uptake in brain (Br) and myocardium (C), and
renal excretion into the urinary bladder (B) are
visible. Also seen is a tumour (T) in the lungs
that takes up more 18F radiotracer than the sur-
rounding  tissues.  Adapted  with  permission
