Fig. 3 pO2 maps of rat tumours obtained using 19F nuclear magnetic reso-
nance using hexafluorobenzene as the reporter molecule. The H tumour (a
well-differentiated and slow-growing tumour) was significantly better oxy-
genated than the AT1 tumour (an anaplastic and faster-growing subline). In
response to oxygen inhalation, pO2 increased significantly in both the H and
the  AT1  tumours. Adapted with permission from Neoplasma press, Zhao
