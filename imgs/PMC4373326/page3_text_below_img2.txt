The main strategy for tracer imaging of tissue hypoxia to date
has  involved  the  use  of  compounds  that  are  preferentially
absorbed and trapped within cells in the reduced state. As the first
such  agent  to  be  developed,  18F-  fluoromisonidazole  is  the  gold
standard and has been used to identify hypoxic tumours in human
patients [6]. Because it has many disadvantages (slow clearance
and low cellular uptake), newer radiotracers for hypoxia imaging
have  been  intensively  investigated.  For  example,  Copper(II)-
diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)  (Cu-ATSM) 
is  a
hypoxia-targeted  PET  agent,  which  displays  a  higher  uptake
