Figure 5. KDM6B is required for BMP and HOX gene expression in MSCs by removal of
H3K27me3 marks
(A and B) Knock-down of KDM6B inhibited the basal levels of BMP2 and BMP4
expression as determined by Real-time RT-PCR. (C) Knock-down of KDM6B inhibited
RUNX2 expression during MSC differentiation. (D, E, F and G) Knock-down of KDM6B
inhibited the basal levels of HOX gene expression in MSCs as assessed Real-time RT-PCR.
(H, I and J) Knock-down of KDM6B reduced KDM6B binding to the promoters of BMP2,
BMP4 and HOXC6-1 in MSCs. The promoters of BMP2, BMP4 and HOXC6-1 were ChIP-
ed with anti-KDM6B antibodies or IgG control. The 3 to 4 kb downstream of the
transcriptional start site was also ChIPed with anti-KDM6B. (K, L and M) Knock-down of
KDM6B increased H3K27me3 levels at the promoters of BMP2, BMP4 and HOXC6-1. **P
