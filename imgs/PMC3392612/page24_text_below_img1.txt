Figure 7. H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 in MSCs are significantly increased in osteoporotic or aging
bone marrow of mice
(A) The percentage of H3K27me3-positive MSCs was increased in bone marrow after OVX.
The total number of double nestin- and H3K27me3-positive MSCs from 5 different fields
were counted and compared with the total number of nestin-positive MSCs. n = 6; *P<0.05.
(B) The percentage of H3K9me3-positive MSCs was increased in bone marrow after OVX.
n= 6, *P<0.05. (C) Trabecular bones were decreased and adipose tissues were increased in
ageing mice by histological analysis. Scale bar, 100 μm. (D) Representative μCT image of
bone loss in aging mice. Scale bar, 0.4 mm. (E) BMD was reduced in ageing mice. n = 8,
*P<0.05. (F) Bone volume was reduced in aging mice. *P<0.05. (G) Immunofluorescence
double staining of nestin- and H3K27me3- or H3K9me3-positive MSCs in bone marrow
