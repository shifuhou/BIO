Figure 6. KDM4B is required for DLX gene expression in MSCs by removal of H3K9me3 marks
(A, B and C) Knock-down of KDM4B inhibited the expression of DLX5, DLX2 and DLX3
induced by BMP4/7, as determined by Real-time RT-PCR. **P < 0.01. (D) The knock-down
of KDM4B inhibited OSX expression induced by BMP4/7. (E) BMP4/7 induced KDM4B
binding to the DLX5 promoter. MSCs were treated with BMP4/7 for 4 hr and the DLX5
promoter was ChIP-ed with anti-KDM4B or IgG control. The 4 kb downstream of the
transcriptional start site was also ChIPed with anti-KDM4B. (F) BMP4/7 promoted the
removal of H3K9me3 in the DLX5 promoter. (G) Knock-down of KDM4B inhibited the
recruitment of KDM4B to the DLX5 promoter. (H) Knock-down of KDM4B abolished
BMP-induced removal of H3K9me3 marks at the DLX5 promoter. **P < 0.01. See also
