Figure 3. KDM4B is required for osteogenic differentiation of MSCs
(A) Over-expression of KDM4B in MSCs. MSC/KDM6B, MSCs expressing KDM6B;
MSC/V, MSCs expressing empty vector. (B) Over-expression of KDM4B enhanced ALP
activities in MSC differentiation. Values are mean ± s.d for triplicate samples from a
representative experiment. **P < 0.01. (C) Over-expression of KDM4B enhanced
mineralization in MSC differentiation. **P < 0.01. (D) The knock-down of KDM4B by
shRNA. MSC/KDM4Bsh, MSCs expressing KDM4B shRNA; MSC/Scrsh, MSCs
expressing scramble shRNA. (E) The knock-down of KDM4B inhibited ALP activities in
MSCs. Values are mean ± s.d for triplicate samples from a representative experiment. **P <
0.01. (F) Knock-down of KDM4B inhibited mineralization in MSCs. **P < 0.01. (G)
Knock-down of KDM4B inhibited OCN expression in MSCs as determined by Real-time
