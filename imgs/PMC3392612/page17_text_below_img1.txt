Figure 2. KDM6B is required for osteogenic differentiation of MSCs
(A) Over-expression of KDM6B in MSCs. (B) Over-expression of KDM6B enhanced ALP
activities in MSC differentiation. Values are mean ± s.d for triplicate samples from a
representative experiment. **P < 0.01. (C) The over-expression of KDM6B enhanced
mineralization in MSC differentiation. Mineralization was stained with Alizarin Red and
qualitatively measured. **P < 0.01. (D) The knock-down of KDM6B by shRNA. MSC/
KDM6Bsh, MSCs expressing KDM6B shRNA; MSC/Scrsh, MSCs expressing scramble
shRNA. (E) The knock-down of KDM6B inhibited ALP activities in MSCs. Values are
mean ± s.d for triplicate samples from a representative experiment. **P < 0.01. (F) The
knock-down of KDM6B inhibited mineralization in MSCs. **P < 0.01. (G) The knock-
down of KDM6B inhibited BSP expression in MSCs as determined by Real-time RT-PCR.
**P < 0.01. (H) The knock-down of KDM6B inhibited OPN expression in MSCs as
determined by Real-time RT-PCR. **P < 0.01. (I) The knock-down of KDM6B inhibited
OCN expression in MSCs as determined by Real-time RT-PCR. **P < 0.01. (J) The
restoration of KDM6B and mutant KDM6B in Kdm6b knock-down MSCs by Western blot
analysis. (K) The catalytically mutant KDM6B could not restore the expression of osteoblast
marker genes in MSCs. (L) The catalytically mutant KDM6B could not restore ALP
activities in MSCs. (M) The knock-down of KDM6B inhibited BMP-enhanced ALP
activities in MSCs. **P < 0.01. (N) The knock-down of KDM6B inhibited BMP-enhanced
mineralization in MSCs. **P < 0.01. See also Figure S2
