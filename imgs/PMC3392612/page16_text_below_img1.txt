Figure 1. KDM4B and KDM6B were induced by BMP/SMAD signaling in MSCs
(A) BMP4/7-induced histone demethylases in MSC by gene expression profiling. The
mRNA expression of histone demethylases was assessed by Real-time RT-PCR. (B) The
knock-down of SMAD4 by shRNA. SMAD4 expression was examined by Western Blot
analysis. (C) The knock-down of SMAD4 inhibited KDM4B in MSCs. KDM4B mRNA was
examined by Real-time RT-PCR. (D) The knock-down of SMAD4 inhibited KDM6B
expression in MSCs. KDM6B mRNA levels were assessed by Real-time RT-PCR. ** P <
0.01. (E) The knock-down of SMAD1 by siRNA. (F) The knock-down of SMAD1 inhibited
KDM4B in MSCs. (G) The knock-down of SMAD1 inhibited KDM6B expression in MSCs.
** P < 0.01. See also Figure S1.
