Extended Data Figure 9. S-2HG induces global histione H3 methylation changes in CD8+ T-
lymphocytes.
a/ Immunoblot analysis on nuclear extracts for histone H3 methylation marks in activated 
CD8+ T-lymphocytes treated with the indicated doses of S-2HG for 7 days.
b/Representative flow cytometry histograms of H3K27me3 staining as a function of 
increasing S-2HG-octyl ester concentration.
c/ H3K27me3 staining in CD8+ T-lymphocytes treated with or without 500 Î¼M S-2HG-octyl 
ester and stained with or without fluorophore conjugated C36B11 antibody.
