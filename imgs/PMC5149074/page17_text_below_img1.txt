Extended Data Figure 6. Ex vivo treatment of CD8+ T-lymphocytes with S-2HG promotes in vivo 
homeostatic proliferation and recall of adoptively transferred cells.
a/ Diagram outlining the homeostatic proliferation experiments in Figure 4a-c. 
Representative flow cytometry plots are shown for each pool before and after adoptive 
transfer. Flow cytometry plots show viable CD8+ cells.
b/Diagram outlining the recall experiments in Figure 4f.
c/ Representative flow cytometry plots of recalling CD45.1+ CD8+ T-lymphocytes in 
indicated organs on day 7 post vaccination (day 37 post transfer).
