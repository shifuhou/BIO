Extended Data Figure 3. Na√Øve and expanding primary CD8+ T-lymphocytes do not possess 
mutations in Idh1 or Idh2 that can explain the presence of high levels of 2HG.
a/ Illustration outlining the workflow for mutational analysis of Idh1 and Idh2
b/ Sanger sequencing chromatograms validating the presence of wild type Idh1 as compared 
to the C57BL/6J NCBI reference sequence.
c/ Alignment of mouse and human IDH1 protein indicating conservation of active site 
arginine residues.
d/ Sanger sequencing chromatograms validating the presence of wild type Idh2 as compared 
to the C57BL/6J NCBI reference sequence.
e/ Alignment of mouse and human IDH2 protein indicating conservation of active site 
arginine residues.
