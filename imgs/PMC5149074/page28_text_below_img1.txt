Figure 3. S-2HG alters phenotypic marker expression of CD8+ T-lymphocytes
a/ Media IL-2 levels from S-2HG-treated cells.
b/ Expression of Il2 mRNA in S-2HG-treated cells.
c/ CD62L and CD127 expression on from S-2HG-treated OT-I cellsn=4 mice.
d/ % CD62LHighCD44Low and % CD62LLowCD44High cells with S-2HG treatment. n=4 
mice.
e/CD62L expression on cells treated with S-2HG and transduced with empty or L2hgdh-
FLAG over-epression vectors.
f/ Representative flow cytommetry plots of KLRG1 vs CD127 (n=4) on cells from e. 
Associated statistics are shown.
g/ S-2HG level in response to shRNA against L2hgdh (n=4).
h/ CD62L expression in response to L2hgdh knockdown (n=4). Representative flow 
cytometry histogram of CD62L surface levels is shown on the right.
Two-way ANOVA (a, b, e, f). One-way ANOVA (c, d, g, h). Error bars denote s.d. .Each dot 
in a, b, e, f, h, represents a mouse. ns=non-significant, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
