Extended Data Figure 10. S-2HG induces global changes in the content of 5hmC and 5mC in 
genomic DNA of CD8+ T-lymphocyte genomic DNA.
a/ Representative flow cytometry plots of CD44 vs CD6L expression on CD8+ T-
lymphocytes with shRNA-mediated knockdown of Tet2, 7 days after trasnduction. Gated on 
live, CD8+GFP+ cells. Graph on right shows knockdown hairpin fidelity for Tet2.
b/ IgG control DIP-qPCR for 5mC and 5hmC at and around the TSS for CD62L, in freshly 
isolated naïve or activated CD8+ T-lymphocytes treated with or without 500 μM S-2HG for 
7 days. Each profile shows the fold change over the non-binding control primer. Each dot
