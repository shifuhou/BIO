a/ 2HG in naïve and activated cells, n≥4 mice per time point.
b/ 2HG in cells cultured at 21% or 1% oxygen 48 h; n=12 mice.
c/ 2HG in cells cultured at 21% (n=15), 10% (n=6), 5% (n=10) or 1% (n=6) oxygen for 48 
h.
d/ Enantioselective MS for S- and R-2HG.
e/ 2HG in human cells( n=4 healthy donors).
f/ Enantioselective MS for S- and R-2HG from cells in e.
g-h/ 2HG in Hif1αfl/fl and Hif1αfl/fl dlckcre (g) or Hif2αfl/fl and Hif2αfl/fl dlckcre (h) cells, 
cultured as in b; n=4 mice per genotype.
i/ 2HG in splenic extracts from Hif1αfl/fl (n=20) and Hif1αfl/fl dlckcre (n=15) mice.
j/ 2HG in urine from Hif1αfl/fl (n=49) and Hif1αfl/fl dlckcre (n=25) mice.
k/. S-2HG in cells with shLdha. n=4 individual transductions.
l/ Ldha-FLAG (n=6) or Pdk1-FLAG (n=4) over-expression in Hif1αfl/fl dlckcre cells. The 
dotted line represents S-2HG levels in Hif1αfl/fl cells n=4/6 individual tranductions.
m/ 13C-isotopologue profile of 2HG in cells cultured as in b ; n=7 mice per condition.
Unpaired t-test ( i, j). Paired t-test (b, l, m). One-way ANOVA (c, k) and two-way ANOVA 
(g, h). Error bars denote s.d.; each dot in a, b, c, i and j represents a. ns = non-significant, 
*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
