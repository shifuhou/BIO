Extended Data Figure 2. HIF-1α-dependent metabolic alterations underlie S-2HG production in 
CD8+ T-lymphocytes.
a/ Example calculation of intracellular 2HG concentration.
b/ 1H-NMR analysis for 2HG from CD8+ T-lymphocytes cultured as in Fig. 2b.
c/ Deletion efficiency of Hif1α or Hif2α in CD8+ T-lymphocytes, isolated from 
Hif1αfl/fldlckcre or Hif2αfl/fldlckcre mice. n=4 mice.
d/ Total 2HG levels, normalized to viable cell count or protein content, in Hif1αfl/fl and 
Hif1αfl/fldlckcre CD8+ T-lymphocytes cultured as in Fig. 2b. n=4 mice per genotype.
