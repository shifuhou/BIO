Extended Data Figure 8. S-2HG does not induce Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl that can explain the in vivo 
persistence of adoptively transferred CD8+ T-lymphocytes.
a/qPCR quantification of Bcl2 and Bclxl mRNA levels in response to 500 μM S-2HG-octyl 
ester treatment for either 1 or 7 days. n=4 mice
b/Immunnoblot analysis for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl protein in response to increasing doses of 
S-2HG-octyl ester for 9 days.
c/qPCR quantification of Bcl2 and Bclxl mRNA levels in response to 300 μM S-2HG-octyl 
ester treatment for either 1, 7 or 9 days. n=4 mice
