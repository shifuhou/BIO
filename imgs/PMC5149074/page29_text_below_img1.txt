capacity of transferred cells
a/ Recovery of co-transferred CD45.1+ OT-I cells, from spleens (n=6).
b/In vivo CFSE levels in cells from a.
c/ % of cells in a that divided 0-9 times in vivo.
d/ Representative flow cytometry plots and associated statistics of recovered cells from 
spleens (n=6).
e/ Representative analysis of cells, in d, relative to na√Øve cells (n=6).
