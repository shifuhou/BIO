Figure 1. VHL-HIF signalling regulates 2-hydroxyglutarate levels
a/ Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and heat map of all detected metabolites.
b/ PCA of metabolomes. Percentage variance of each PC is in parenthesis.
c/ Metabolites ranked in order of decreasing p-value .
d/ 2HG levels in Vhlfl/fl (n=7), Vhlfl/fldlckcre (n=4) and Hif1αfl/fl Vhlfl/fldlckcre (n=4) CD8+ 
T-lymphocytes activated with αCD3 and αCD28 antibodies and then cultured in IL-2 for a 
further 5 days. Each dot represents a mouse.
e/ 2HG levels in RCC4 and 786-O cells with reconstitution of VHL; n=3.
f/ 2HG levels in MEFs with deletion of VHL; n=3.
Unpaired t-test (e-f) and one-way ANOVA (d). Error bars denote s.d.; ns = non-significant, 
*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
