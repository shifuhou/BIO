Figure 5 Genetic reprogramming of MSC under hypoxia. MSC from 3 donors were cultured until P0 and P2. RNA was extracted from each
culture, processed and hybridized on Agilent DNA microarrays. Diagram A shows the GO analysis of differentially expressed transcripts at P0. Six
transcripts were chosen and amplified by qPCR in order to validate gene array results obtained after long term hypoxia using the same extracts.
Mean +/- SD from 3 experiments.
