Fig. 4. Notch ICD induces nuclear accumulation of FIH-1. (A) 293A cells were
transfected with 0.4 (cid:2)g of YFP-fused FIH-1 alone or together with 0.6 (cid:2)g of
plasmids encoding wild-type Notch ICD (WT) or ICD N1945A/N2012A (NNAA).
Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy, and intracellular distribution was
categorized as described in ref. 17. Nuclear compartment was identiﬁed by
DAPI staining. (B) Notch affects cellular localization of FIH-1 in vivo. Chick
neural tubes were electroporated with FIH-1 alone or together with wild-type
or NNAA mutant Notch1 ICD. Cellular localization of FIH-1 was determined by
immunohistochemistry ((cid:1)-FIH-1). The zoom panels on each column corre-
spond to magniﬁcation of the dashed yellow boxes. (C) Levels of FIH-1 mRNA
in cells transfected with control siRNA and FIH-1-speciﬁc siRNA and analyzed
by quantitative RT-PCR. (D) siRNA targeting FIH-1 produces a modest effect on
Notch-dependent luciferase activity. 293T cells stably expressing full-length
Notch and plated on IgG (ligand (cid:8)) or Jagged-1-coated plates (ligand (cid:7)) were
ﬁrst transfected with 100 nM negative control or a FIH-1-speciﬁc siRNA and
24 h later were transfected again with 0.5 (cid:2)g of 12(cid:6)CSL-Luc plasmid. (E)
Inhibition of FIH-1 expression by siRNA mediates derepression of HIF-1(cid:1)CAD
function. Twenty-four hours after transfection with siRNAs, a GAL4-driven
luciferase plasmid (0.5 (cid:2)g) and an expression plasmid encoding GAL4-fused
HIF-1(cid:1) C-TAD (50 ng) were transfected. Data are presented as luciferase
activity relative to cells transfected with reporter gene alone. Values represent
the mean (cid:2) SE of three independent experiments performed in duplicate.
