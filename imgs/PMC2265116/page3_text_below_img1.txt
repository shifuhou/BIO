Fig. 2. Mutation of Notch 1 ICD N1945 and N2012 reduces the transactivation
potency and impairs Notch-mediated repression of neuronal differentiation.
(A) Notch N1945/N2012 is a very weak transcriptional activator. P19 cells were
transfected with 0.5 (cid:2)g of a CSL-driven luciferase plasmid and 100 ng of CMX
or plasmids encoding wild-type (WT), N1945A, or N1945A/N2012A (NNAA)
mutant ICD. (B) Activity of Notch Asn mutants is rescued by expression of
MAML1. HeLa cells were transfected with 0.5 (cid:2)g of 12(cid:6)CSL-Luc plasmid
together with 100 ng of plasmids encoding WT or mutant forms of Notch 1 ICD
in the presence of increasing concentrations of an expression vector (50 ng and
200 ng) encoding MAML1. Data are presented as luciferase activity relative to
cells transfected with 12(cid:6)CSL-Luc. Values represent the mean (cid:2) SE of three
independent experiments performed in duplicate. (C) Schematic representa-
tion of a harvested chicken embryo after electroporation. Transverse sections
at the forelimb level (dashed line) were analyzed. In the electroporated spinal
cord, only one of the sides was electroporated (red region). The analysis was
focused on the most ventral region of the spinal cord (boxed region). Quan-
tiÔ¨Åcation of the effect on motor neuron generation after expression of GFP or
WT; N1945A, or NNAA Notch1 ICD is shown. The percentage of cells electro-
porated with the indicated constructs and expressing the postmitotic motor
neuron marker Isl1/2 (D), and the ratio of the total number of motor neurons
between the electroporated vs. control (el/co) side (E) were determined. (F)
Effect of wild-type and mutant forms of Notch on neurogenesis in the ventral
spinal cord. Embryos were electroporated with GFP or with wild-type or
mutant Notch1 ICD as indicated. The ability of the different constructs to
maintain cells in a progenitor stage or to repress motor neuron generation
was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against Sox3 or
