Fig. 5. Activation of Notch increases binding of HIF-1(cid:1) to target genes and
causes derepression of HIF-1(cid:1) function. (A) Binding of HIF-1(cid:1) to target gene
HREs by ChIP analysis in the absence or presence of activated Notch. C2C12
cells stably expressing full-length Notch were cultured in the presence of
control 293T cells (ligand (cid:8)) or 293T cells stably expressing Notch ligand
Serrate-1 (ligand (cid:7)) and kept at normoxia (N) or exposed to hypoxia (H). ChIP
assays were performed using the indicated antibodies, and RT-PCR analysis of
target gene HREs was carried out. (B) Activation of the Notch pathway
increases HIF-1 target gene expression. 293T cells stably expressing full-length
Notch were cultured on plates coated with IgG (ligand (cid:8)) or Jagged-1 (ligand
(cid:7)) and kept at normoxia (N) or hypoxia (H). Total RNA was prepared, and
quantitative RT-PCR was performed. (C) Notch ICD derepresses HIF-1(cid:1) CAD
function. P19 cells were transfected with 0.5 (cid:2)g of a GAL4-driven luciferase
plasmid and 50 ng of GAL-fused HIF-1(cid:1) C-TAD expression plasmid in the
presence of increasing amounts (50, 100, and 200 ng) of plasmids encoding
wild-type or Asn mutant Notch1 ICD. (D) Expression of wild-type FIH-1 restores
repression of CAD function at normoxia. P19 cells were transfected with 0.5 (cid:2)g
of a GAL4-driven luciferase plasmid together with a GAL-fused HIF-1(cid:1) CAD
expression plasmid (50 ng) and a plasmid encoding wild-type Notch 1 ICD (200
ng) in the presence of increasing amounts (50, 100, 200 ng) of plasmids
encoding wild-type or mutant (D201A and D199A) FIH-1. Data are presented
as luciferase activity relative to cells transfected with GAL4-Luc. Values rep-
resent the mean (cid:2) S.E. of three independent experiments performed in
duplicate (C and D).
