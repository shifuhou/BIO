Figure 2. Vascular Effects of Continuous and Intermittent Hypoxia
(A) Prolonged continuous alveolar hypoxia results in pulmonary arterial hypertension due to
the activation of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α, leading to changes in pulmonary arterioles that
reduce luminal diameter, thereby increasing pulmonary vascular resistance.
(B) Chronic intermittent hypoxia results in systemic arterial hypertension due to activation
of HIF-1α and degradation of HIF-2α. Increased HIF-1α-dependent expression of NADPH
oxidase 2 (NOX2), which generates superoxide anion, and decreased HIF-2α-dependent
expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), which consumes superoxide, result in
increased ROS levels in the carotid body, leading to sympathetic nervous system activation
and systemic hypertension.
