Figure 1. Regulation of Glucose Metabolism
Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 activates the transcription of genes encoding: glucose
transporters and glycolytic enzymes, which increase flux of glucose to pyruvate; PDK1
(encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase), which inactivates PDH (pyruvate
dehydrogenase), the mitochondrial enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA for entry
into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA/citric acid/Krebs) cycle; LDHA, which converts pyruvate to
lactate; and BNIP3 and BNIP3L, which induce mitochondrial autophagy. The shunting of
substrate away from the mitochondria reduces ATP production but prevents excess ROS
production that occurs due to inefficient electron transport under hypoxic conditions.
