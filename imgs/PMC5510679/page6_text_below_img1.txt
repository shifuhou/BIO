translation modiﬁcations to HIF-1a [29]. To question the
potential role of SUMO in HIF-1a-mediated proliferation
in MSCs, we repeated the BrdU incorporation study using 50 mM
AA, an inhibitor of SUMO ligase. As expected, cell proliferation
was signiﬁcantly higher in HIF-MSCs than in MSCs; however,
the HIF-1a-mediated increase in cell proliferation was com-
pletely abolished by AA treatment, demonstrating the relevance
of the SUMO pathway for HIF-1a-induced MSC proliferation
(Fig. 4B).
