(p38/MAPK) [25,31], JNK/SAP [25], AKT [25], and Notch
[32,33], together with ﬁbronectin [34,35], ﬁbroblast growth
factor [25,36], angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) [37], NGF [38],
and insulin growth factor [25,39] signaling pathways, are
all induced by HIF-1a. We examined Notch signaling
since hypoxia can promote Notch pathway activation
and HIF-1a is a key mediator in the adaptation of eu-
karyotic cells to hypoxia. We ﬁrst compared Notch
downstream target gene expression in HIF-MSCs and
MSCs. Activation of Notch signaling in HIF-MSCs was
observed when HIF-MSCs were cultured at conﬂuence
or seeded at low density on Jagged1-coated plates, in-
dicating that HIF-1a enhanced Notch signaling only
after activation of the Notch receptor. This is in accor-
dance with previous studies showing that hypoxia in-
creases activation levels of Notch1 in different tumor
cell lines only after coculture with a Jagged1-expressing
cell line [27].
