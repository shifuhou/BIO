In summary, we demonstrate at the molecular and cellular
levels the mechanism underlying HIF-SUMO-Notch cross-
talk in hMSCs and how this interaction results in (i) auto-
activation of Notch signaling pathway, (ii) increased Notch
ligand expression, (iii) increased levels of SUMO and SU-
MOylation of N1ICD, (iv) increased N1ICD nuclear trans-
location, and (v) increased migration,
invasiveness, and
proliferation of HIF-MSCs. The relationship between the
Notch pathway and cancer is well recognized [50]. Thus,
this novel level of regulation for N1ICD could have po-
tential implications in cancer pathogenesis. Further studies
are needed to identify the residues SUMOylated in N1ICD
and to elucidate whether higher concentrations of N1ICD by
increased g-secretase activity or higher SUMO-mediated
nuclear translocation of N1ICD account for the enhanced
Notch activity in HIF-MSCs.
