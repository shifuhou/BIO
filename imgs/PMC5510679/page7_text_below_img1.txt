between HIF and SUMO pathways. To explore this functional
relationship, we ﬁrst analyzed the protein sequence of the
Notch1 receptor with SUMOplot(cid:5) Analysis software, a
program that predicts and scores SUMOylation sites in pro-
tein sequences. The results of this analysis showed six po-
tential motifs with high probability of representing the SUMO
binding site on the N1ICD (not shown). We next
im-
munoprecipitated N1ICD in MSCs and HIF-MSCs with an
anti-N1ICD antibody and performed western blotting for
SUMO1. We observed that N1ICD was susceptible to
SUMOylation and, moreover, levels of SUMOylated N1ICD
were higher in HIF-MSCs than in MSCs (Fig. 5C). Additional
analysis using an InCell Analyzer to quantify N1ICD nuclear
translocation [30] conﬁrmed that levels of N1ICD were sig-
niﬁcantly higher in the nuclei of Notch-activated HIF-MSCs
than in equivalent MSCs and also showed that AA abolished
N1ICD nuclear translocation (Fig. 5D). Overall, these results
indicate a functional
relationship between SUMO and
Notch1, whereby cellular SUMO levels can affect N1ICD
nuclear translocation. To further corroborate SUMOylation
of N1ICD, we performed subcellular fractionation experi-
ments and western blotting using MSCs and HIF-MSCs cul-
tured on Jagged 1-coated plates and treated or not with AA to
modulate SUMOylation. Analysis of N1ICD expression in
nuclear fractions revealed a reduction in nuclear expression of
the protein in the presence of the SUMO inhibitor (Fig. 5E).
