moxia/hypoxia and treated or not with AA. Protein extracts
were immunoprecipitated with an anti-N1ICD antibody and
SUMOylated proteins were detected using an anti-SUMO1
antibody. We observed that N1ICD was SUMOylated both in
normoxia and hypoxia and that treatment with AA decreased
this post-translational modiÔ¨Åcation, especially under hypoxia
(Fig. 7E).
