Figure 6. Hypoxic preconditioning facilitates survival, proliferation, and angiogenic cytokine
secretion of transplanted MSCs in a murine hind-limb ischemia model. After establishing the
murine hind-limb ischemia model, ischemic-injured tissues were collected at postoperative day 3.
(A) Immunoﬂuorescence staining for cleaved caspase-3 (green) and human nuclear antigen (HNA;
red). Scale bar = 50 µm; (B) Apoptosis of transplanted MSCs was quantiﬁed as the number of cleaved
caspase-3 and HNA double-positive cells or ND (none detected). Values represent the mean ± SEM
(n = 3). ** p < 0.01 vs. PBS, ## p < 0.01 vs. Nor-MSC, $$ p < 0.01 vs. Hypo-MSCs; (C) Immunoﬂuorescence
staining for Ki-67 (green) and HNA (red). Scale bar = 50 µm; (D) Proliferation of transplanted MSCs
was quantiﬁed as the number of Ki67 and HNA double-positive cells or ND. Values represent the
mean ± SEM (n = 3). ** p <0.01 vs. PBS, ## p < 0.01 vs. Nor-MSC, $$ p < 0.01 vs. Hypo-MSCs; (E–G)
Expression of human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF) (E), human hepatocyte growth
factor (hHGF) (F), and human ﬁbroblast growth factor (hFGF) (G) in ischemic limb tissue lysates was
determined by ELISA. Values represent the mean ± SEM (n = 3). ** p < 0.01 vs. PBS, ## p < 0.01 vs.
Nor-MSC, $$ p < 0.05 vs. Hypo-MSC.
