Figure 5. Transplantation of hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs regulates stress- and apoptosis-associated
signal pathway in ischemic-injured tissue. (A) Western blot analysis of Akt, c-Jun N-terminal kinases
(JNK), p38, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) phosphorylation
in ischemic sites of mice injected with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), normoxic MSCs (Nor-MSC),
hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs (Hypo-MSC), and Hypo-MSCs pretreated with anti-GRP78 antibody
(Hypo-MSC+GRP78 Ab; 100 ng/mL) at day 3 after MSC transplantation; (B) The expression levels
of p-Akt, p-JNK, and p-p38, and p-NF-κB were normalized to those of Akt, JNK, and p38, and
NF-κB, respectively. Values represent the mean ± SEM (n = 3).* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 vs. PBS,
# p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 vs. Nor-MSC, $ p < 0.05 and $$ p < 0.01 vs. Hypo-MSC; (C) Western
blot analysis of B-cell lymphoma (BCL)2, BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), cleaved caspase-3, and
cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase(PARP)-1 in ischemic sites of mice injected with PBS, Nor-MSC,
Hypo-MSC, and Hypo-MSC+GRP78 Ab at day 3 after MSC transplantation; (D) The expression levels
of BCL2, BAX, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP-1 were normalized to that of α-tubulin. Values
represent the mean ± SEM (n = 3).* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 vs. PBS and ## p < 0.01 vs. Nor-MSC,
$ p < 0.05 and $$ p < 0.01 vs. Hypo-MSC.
