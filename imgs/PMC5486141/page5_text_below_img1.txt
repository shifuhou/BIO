Figure 3. Hypoxic preconditioning increases the expression of cell cycle-associated protein through the
GRP78-Akt pathway. (A) Western blot analysis of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin E, CDK4,
and cyclin D1 in MSCs exposed to hypoxia for 0, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h; (B) The expression levels of CDK2,
cyclin E, CDK4, and cyclin D1 were normalized to that of β-actin. Values represent the mean ± SEM
(n = 3). * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 vs. normoxia; (C) Western blot analysis of CDK2, cyclin E, CDK4, and
cyclin D1 in MSCs exposed to hypoxia for 12 h after pretreatment with anti-GRP78 antibody (GRP78
Ab; 100 ng/mL) or Akt inhibitor (10−6 M); (D) The expression levels of CDK2, cyclin E, CDK4, and
cyclin D1 were normalized to that of β-actin. Values represent the means ± SEM (n = 3).* p < 0.05 and
** p < 0.01 vs. normoxia, # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 vs. hypoxia, $ p < 0.05 and $$ p < 0.01 vs. hypoxia
pretreated with anti-GRP78 antibody.
