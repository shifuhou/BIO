Figure 1. OXPHOS, but Not Aerobic Glycolysis, Is Required for the Activation of T Cells
(A) OCR and ECAR of naive and activated T cells were assessed. Activated CD4+ T cells
were obtained from L. monocytogenes-infected mice or after in vitro stimulation with anti-
CD3/28 for 72 hr. OCR/ECAR ratio of the cells was also determined; *p = 0.014 and **p <
0.0001.
(B) CFSE-labeled naive T cells were activated with anti-CD3/28 in the presence or absence
of oligomycin (Oligo) for indicated times, and then proliferation was measured by CFSE
dilution.
(C) Naive T cells were activated with anti-CD3/28 for 72 hr in the absence (no drug) or in
the presence of oligomycin. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the activation
markers CD44 and CD25 were determined and normalized to the level expressed in naive
cells; *p = 0.001 for CD44, *p = 0.002 for CD25.
(D) OCR of T cells that were activated with anti-CD3/28 and cultured in the presence of low
concentrations of oligomycin for 3 days, *p = 0.0001.
(E) CFSE-labeled naive T cells were activated with anti-CD3/28 and cultured in medium
supplemented either with (+Glc) or without (−Glc) glucose or with galactose (+Gal),or
galactose plus oligomycin (+Gal/Oligo) for 6 days. CFSE dilution was measured 1, 3, or 6
days after activation.
(F) Live-cell (7AAD−) numbers of T cells were determined and normalized to the number
of live cells cultured in glucose medium at the indicated times.
(G) OCR and ECAR of T cells that were activated for 3 days with anti-CD3/28 and cultured
in medium supplemented either with glucose (+Glc) or galactose (+Gal), *p = 0.0001.
