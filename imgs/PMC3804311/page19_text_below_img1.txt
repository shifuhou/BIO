Figure 5. GAPDH Associates with the AU-Rich Region of the IFN-γ 3′ UTR and Regulates IFN-γ
Production
(A) T cells cultured in glucose (Glc) were transduced with UTR-sensor constructs for 2 days
and then recultured in galactose (Gal) for 1 more day before GFP fluorescence was
measured by flow cytometry. The percentage of GFP+ cells is depicted on the top left, and
the MFI of those GFP+ events is shown vertically as indicated.
(B) GAPDH-specific antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate GAPDH from extracts of
indicated UTR-sensor construct-transduced T cells cultured in media with Gal. Associated
GFP mRNA bound to GAPDH was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Data show results from one
experiment that is normalized to the ARE* mutant IFN-γ 3′ UTR construct-transduced cells.
(C) T cells were transfected with Scrambled or GAPDH siRNA. Cells were incubated for 24
hr before analyzing IFN-γ by flow cytometry. Shown vertically is the MFI of the events
from IFN-γ-producing cells. Data show a representative result from seven independent
experiments.
(D) GAPDH expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Relative expression of GAPDH
mRNA after Scrambled or GAPDH siRNA transfection is normalized to the GAPDH
expression of Scrambled siRNA samples, p = 0.0049. Bar graph shown as the mean ± SEM
(error bar) is generated from data from four independent experiments.
(E and F) T cells were transduced with GAPDH (GAPDH EX) and empty vector control
retrovirus (EV), and intracellular IFN-γ (E) and IFN-γ secretion by ELISA (F) were
measured after restimulation. Dot plots show IFN-γ MFI from CD4+ T cells and are
representative of three independent experiments; supernatant was collected from one
experiment (mean ± SEM).
(G) Activated T cells were exposed to varying concentrations of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
(G3P) in 0.01% saponin on ice for 10 min prior to restimulation. Data represent similar
results from three independent experiments. See also Figure S5.
