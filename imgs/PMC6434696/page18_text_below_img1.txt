MSC fitness, function, and fate theorem. Culture adapted “fit” MSCs express inflammation-
suppressing paracrine factors that augment Treg function and M2-macrophage polarization 
as well as suppress effector lymphoid cell function. MSCs are also habilitated to produce 
morphogens and exosomes that promote tissular repair. The sum effect of these additive 
functionalities is to drive tissue regeneration. MSCs progressing to apoptosis express “eat-
me” signals such as phosphatidylserine (PtS) and are susceptible to the alternate 
efferocytosis pathway where their engulfment by phagocytic macrophages leads to 
expression of immune tolerance factors. The reciprocal relationship between fitness and 
apoptosis dictates whether MSC metabolism or their efferocytosis, respectively, is 
responsible for their in vivo biological effects.
