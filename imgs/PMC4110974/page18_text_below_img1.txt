Figure 1.
(A) Population doubling of MSCs up to 52 days by actual enumeration (*<0.05 to 20%O2).
Cell counts were expressed as a population doubling of the original cell number seeded in
each well. (B) The level of p16INK4A mRNA transcript in day 52 by quantitative RT-PCR.
(*p<0.05 to 20%O2 in day 0). The level of p16INK4A transcript in day 0 was normalized to
1.0. (C and D) Effects of hypoxic exposure on primary MSC colony formation. 500 cells
were seeded in 10 cm dish and the number of formed colonies was counted in day 14.
(*p<0.05 to 20%O2 condition in D). In (C), shown are representative images of MSC colony
formation under 1%O2, 20%O2, and 20%O2 after pretreatment with 1%O2 for 4 days.
