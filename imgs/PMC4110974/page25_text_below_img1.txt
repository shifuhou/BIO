Hypoxic exposure enhances multipotential stromal cell (MSC) colony formation in a HIF
independent manner. (A) Effects of HIF-1β shRNA against HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-1β on
the colony formation of immortalized-MSCs under 1%O2 and 20%O2 conditions. P-values
are given within the figure. (B) Representative images of colony formation of immortalized-
MSCs with shRNA against HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-1b shRNA or HIF-1β. Non-target
shRNA (NT) served as a control.
