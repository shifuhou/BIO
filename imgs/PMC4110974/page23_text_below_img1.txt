Figure 6.
Hypoxic condition decreases adipogenic differentiation of multipotential stromal cell (MSC)
in an unfolded protein response (UPR)-dependent, but not a HIF-dependent manner. MSCs
were cultured in regular medium (Reg) or stimulated with 2 cycles of adipogenic induction/
maintenance media (Adipo) for 8-10 days, and adipogenic differentiation was evaluated by
mRNA transcript levels of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) by
quantitative RT-PCR (A-I) or by staining intracellular lipid droplets by Oil Red O (J). (A)
Effects of stable HIF-1α or HIF-2α on adipogenic differentiation of immortalized MSCs
under 20%O2 condition. Puromycin-resistant blank expression vector (Ctrl) was used as a
control. (B-E) Effects of HIF-1α shRNA (C), HIF-2α shRNA (D), and HIF-1β shRNA (E)
treatments on adipogenic differentiation of immortalized-MSCs under 20%O2 and 1%O2
conditions. NT shRNA (B) was used as a control. The level of PPARγ transcript in
adipogenic condition under 20%O2 was normalized to 1.0 in each figure. P-values between
20%O2 and 1%O2 conditions in osteogenic condition were given in each figure. (F-J)
Effects of chemical chaperon 4-phenyl butyric acid (PBA) on adipogenic differentiation of
primary MSCs under 20%O2 and 1%O2 conditions. The level of PPARγ transcript in
adipogenic condition under 20%O2 was normalized to 1.0 in each figure. P-values between
20%O2 and 1%O2 conditions in adipogenic condition were given in each figure. (J)
