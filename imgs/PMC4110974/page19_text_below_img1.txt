Effects of hypoxic exposure on the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of human
primary multipotential stromal cells (MSCs). (A) Effects of hypoxic exposure on osteogenic
differentiation of MSCs. Cells were cultured in regular medium (Reg) or osteogenic medium
(Osteo) under 20%O2 (with and without 1%O2 pretreatment for 4 days) or 1%O2 conditions
for 7 days, and an early phase of osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by quantitation of
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in cell lysates. (*p<0.0005 to regular medium control of
each respective condition). (B and C) Effects of hypoxic exposure on adipogenic
differentiation of primary MSCs. Cells were cultured in regular medium (Reg) or 2 cycles of
adipogenic stimulations (Adipo) under 20%O2 (with and without 1%O2 pretreatment for 4
days) or 1%O2 conditions for 8-10 days, and an adipogenic differentiation was evaluated by
mRNA transcript levels of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)
expression relative to RPLPO transcripts (housekeeping gene) by quantitative RT-PCR (B)
or by microscopic observation of intracellular lipid droplets with Oil Red O staining (C)
(*p<0.005 to adipogenic condition under 1%O2 condition). Each photograph is 550 μm
square.
