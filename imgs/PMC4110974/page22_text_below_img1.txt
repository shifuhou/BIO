Hypoxic condition decreases osteogenic differentiation of multipotential stromal cell (MSC)
in a HIF-dependent manner. Immortalized-MSCs were cultured in regular medium (Reg) or
osteogenic medium (Osteo) for 7 days, and an early phase of osteogenic differentiation was
evaluated by quantitation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in cell lysates. (A) Effects
of stable HIF-1α or HIF-2α on osteogenic differentiation under 20%O2 condition.
Puromycin-resistant blank expression vector (Ctrl) was used as a control (*p<0.05,
**p<0.0005 to osteogenic medium of Ctrl vector condition). (B-E) Effects of HIF-1α
shRNA (C), HIF-2α shRNA (D), and HIF-1β shRNA (E) treatments on osteogenic
differentiation of immortalized-MSCs under 20%O2 and 1%O2 conditions. NT shRNA (B)
was used as a control. The level of ALP activity in osteogenic condition under 20%O2 was
normalized to 1.0 in each figure. P-values between 20%O2 and 1%O2 conditions in
osteogenic condition were given in each figure. (N.S. = not significant).
