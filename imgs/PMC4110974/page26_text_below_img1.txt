Figure 8.
Effects of stable form of HIF-1α and HIF-2α (A, C, and E) or HIF-1β shRNA (B, D, and F)
on the secretion of VEGF (A and B), HGF (C and D) and bFGF (E and F) from
immortalized multipotential stromal cells (MSCs). Cells were incubated in the serum-
reduced medium for 24 h under indicated O2 conditions, and the levels of growth factors in
the conditioned media were determined by ELISA. Results were normalized by the amount
of cellular proteins. (*p<0.05 and **p<0.01 to the control under 20%O2 condition in each
figure for A, C, and E, whereas P-values were given in each figure for B, D, and F).
