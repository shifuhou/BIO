Fig. 5. Gross morphological characterization, whole-mount immunohistochemistry and lacZ staining of HIF-1a null embryos obtained from
heterozygous crosses. (A) E8.5 littermates, at which point the embryos are approximately the same size. (B) E9.5 littermates, displaying a substantial
size difference. (C) Yolk sacs from E9.5 littermates. The HIF-1a null yolk sac shows disorganized vascularization compared with the wild-type.
(D) E8.5 littermates stained for the endothelial cell-speciÔ¨Åc marker CD31 demonstrate absence of neural vascularization (arrows) and incomplete
somitic vascularization. (E) Closer view of the neural folds of an E8.5 HIF-1a null embryo stained for CD31 (arrow). (F, G and H) Staining of
heterozygous embryos carrying an in-frame lacZ fusion at the HIF-1a
locus. A distinct pattern of somitic expression is seen in (F), an E8.5 embryo.
At E8.0 (G) we see intense staining in the neural folds (arrows) while at E8.5 (H) the expression appears to be localized to a layer of cells lining the
inner neural ectoderm (arrow).
