Fig. 1. Targeted disruption of the mouse HIF-1a gene. (A) Part of the wild-type HIF-1a
The HIF-1a gene was disrupted by replacement of the HLH with either a neomycin resistance gene alone (pMC1neo) or an in-frame fusion of the
lacZ gene followed by a loxP-ﬂanked pMC1neo. B, BamHI; Bg, BglII; E, EcoRI; P, PstI; X, XbaI. Homologous recombination at the HIF-1a
locus
introduces a new BamHI site. This results in a 5.5 kb targeted band versus a 13 kb endogenous band upon digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI
and hybridization to a 5(cid:57) external probe. (B) Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA showing correct targeting of the HIF-1a
was isolated from R1 ES cells (Nagy and Rossant, 1992), digested with BamHI and hybridized with the 5(cid:57) probe. HIF-1a –/– cells were generated
via high G418 selection (Mortensen et al., 1992). (C) Northern blot analysis of total RNA. Thirty m g of total RNA was loaded per lane and
hybridized with a 345 bp HIF-1a
type and HIF-1a null ES cells. Two binding sites were used: the 18 bp HRE from the EPO gene (Semenza and Wang, 1992) and the 24 bp HRE
from the VEGF gene (Forsythe et al., 1996). Lanes 1, 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10 contain extracts incubated with the EPO HRE. Lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11 and 12
contain extracts incubated with the VEGF HRE. Wild-type ES cells exhibit a shift under hypoxia with either binding site (lanes 2 and 4, arrow).
HIF-1a null ES cells do not show a shift under hypoxia with either binding site (lanes 6, 8, 10 and 12).
