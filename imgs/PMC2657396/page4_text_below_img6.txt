Fig. 4. Hypoxia- and HIF-dependent up-regulation of JHDMs. (A) GSEA analysis
of mRNA expression proﬁles for hypoxic (12 h) vs. normoxic cells with gene set
containing all known JmjC histone demethylases in HepG2 and U87 cells. (B) Gene
expression changes under hypoxia in HepG2 cells. (C) Expression dataset for
Grade IV glioblastoma was interrogated for changes in mRNA levels of the JmjC
family. The most highly up-regulated JmjC family member is shown for normal
tissue (N) vs. tumor (T) samples. Known HIF-1 targets are on the left. Data
represented as the median (bar), 25–75th percentiles (box), and range (whiskers).
(D) Quantitative RT-PCR veriﬁcation of up-regulated expression of HIF-1-bound
JmjC genes under different levels of hypoxia. Results are expressed as mean (cid:9) SD
after normalization to (cid:2)-actin. (E) shRNA depletion of HIF-1(cid:1), HIF-2(cid:1), HIF1(cid:1)and
2(cid:1), or ARNT was used to determine HIF-dependent up-regulation of JmjC pro-
teins. Data represent fold change comparing hypoxic with normoxic samples
(mean (cid:9) SD).
