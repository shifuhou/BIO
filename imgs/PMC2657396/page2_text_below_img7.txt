Fig. 1. HIF-1 ChIP-chip analysis and validation. (A) Representative integrated
genome browser (IGB; Affymetrix) tracks showing peaks of probe intensities
(vertical bars) arrayed by chromosomal position. For each locus, tracks are scaled
identically. ChIP peaks were identiﬁed by using the MAT algorithm and were
classiﬁed as hypoxia-unique, hypoxia-enriched, or nonspeciﬁc. (B) ChIP-chip re-
sults were validated by ChIP-qPCR using primer pairs surrounding the putative
binding sites in the indicated loci. For each locus, the fold enrichment comparing
HIF-1 ChIP DNA to input is represented in the bar graph (mean (cid:9) SD). To
determine speciﬁcity for HIF-1, the bottom heat map depicts the fold enrichment
comparing hypoxic to normoxic cells and control hypoxic cells to cells in which
HIF-1(cid:1)was speciﬁcally depleted with a lentiviral shRNA (sh-HIF1(cid:1)). Primer pairs
locate 5 and 10 kb upstream of the VEGF gene were used as controls.
