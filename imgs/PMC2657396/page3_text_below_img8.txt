Fig. 3. Overrepresentation of 2-OG-dioxygenases among HIF-1 ChIP hits. (A)
HIF-1 target genes in Cluster 1, with previously described HIF-1-bound targets
indicated with an asterisk. (B) HIF-1-targeted 2-OG-dioxygenases in Cluster 2.
Average change (Log2) in mRNA expression levels at 4, 8, and 12 h of hypoxia in
HepG2, U87 and MDA-MB231 cells are indicated by using the assigned color scale.
(C) Representative IGB tracks showing HIF-1 binding at promoter regions of the
2-OG-dioxygenase family genes in HepG2 and U87 cell lines. For each locus, tracks
are scaled identically between hypoxia (H) and normoxia (N) samples.
