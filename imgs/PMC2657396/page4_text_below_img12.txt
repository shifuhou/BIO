Fig. 5. Histone hypermethylations from loss of JHDM induction in hypoxia. (A)
A representative immunoblot analysis of total histone H3 and the speciﬁed
modiﬁcations in biological replicates (1 and 2) under normoxic (N) and hypoxic
conditions (O2 levels indicated). (B) Quantitation of a single representative study
is shown, with results for each modiﬁcation normalized to total histone H3 within
each sample (mean (cid:9) SD). (C) Accumulation of JARID1B protein under hypoxia
was veriﬁed by Western blot analysis with a JARID1B-speciﬁc antibody, with
speciﬁcity veriﬁed by shRNA depletion of JARID1B (Left). Knockdown of ARNT
(sh-ARNT) (Right) reduces accumulation of JARID1B in hypoxia. (D) Global histone
H3 and H3K4me3 levels were determined in unmodiﬁed HepG2 cells, control
shRNA cells (sh-GFP), and ARNT depleted cells (sh-ARNT). Western blot analysis for
histone H3 and H3K4me3 of duplicate biological replicates (1 and 2) is shown for
a representative experiment. (E) Quantitated results represented as mean (cid:9) SD.
(F) A HA-JARID1B expression construct was transfected into HepG2 sh-ARNT cells.
Normoxic and hypoxic cells were stained with anti-HA (red) and anti-H3K4me3
(green) antibodies. In both conditions, overexpression of JARID1B reduced the
H3K4me3 level by comparing transfected cells (with arrows) to nontransfected
cells.
