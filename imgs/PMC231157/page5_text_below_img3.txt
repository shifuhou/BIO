FIG. 6. Gel mobility shift assay of the XRE and the heterodimeric complexes of AhR with Arnt2 and Arnt. Human AhR produced in Sf21 cells with a baculovirus
expression system was incubated in the presence or absence of 3-MC (1 (cid:109)M) with either Arnt2 (lanes 3 to 7) or Arnt (lanes 8 to 12) synthesized in vitro. A 32P-labeled
XRE probe was added to the solution with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled XRE probes (W) or mutated XRE probes (M) and then electrophoresed on a
4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel after an additional 30 min of incubation. Only the labeled probe was electrophoresed in lane 1. One of the heterodimeric
subunits was used in lanes 2, 3, and 8. Arrowheads indicate the retarded bands. NS, nonspeciÔ¨Åc bands.
