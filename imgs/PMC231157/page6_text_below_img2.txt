FIG. 7. Transfection of Arnt2 and Arnt expression plasmids in c4, an Arnt-
deÔ¨Åcient mutant of the Hepa-1 cell line. (A) The c4 cell line was cotransfected
with the CAT reporter plasmid pMC6.3K (4 (cid:109)g), which carries a 6.3-kb upstream
sequence of the CYP1A1 gene, together with one of the three expression plas-
mids (4 (cid:109)g) constructed from pCMSV: vector alone, pCMSVArnt2, or pCMS-
VArnt. CAT activities were assayed after a 2-day incubation in the presence or
absence of 3-MC (1 (cid:109)M) and normalized on the basis of the CAT activity of the
c4 cells transfected with the Arnt expression plasmid without 3-MC. The columns
show average CAT activities from three independent experiments, with standard
deviations. (B) A representative result of the CAT assay.
