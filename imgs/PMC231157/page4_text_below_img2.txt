FIG. 3. RNA blot analysis of total RNAs from various tissues of adult mice
and mouse embryos. Total RNAs (20 (cid:109)g) were electrophoresed on a 0.8%
agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 M formaldehyde and blotted to a nylon
membrane. The membrane was probed with 0.82-kb Arnt2 (A) and 1.15-kb Arnt
(B) cDNA probes and washed twice in 0.1(cid:51) SSCâ€“0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65(cid:56)C.
The positions of 28S and 18S rRNAs are shown on the right. The membrane was
hybridized with the 1.15-kb Arnt cDNA probe and then subjected to dehybrid-
ization before hybridization with the 0.82-kb Arnt2 cDNA probe. (C) rRNAs
stained with ethidium bromide as a control.
