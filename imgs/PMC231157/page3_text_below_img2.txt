FIG. 2. Alignment of bHLH/PAS and PAS protein sequences in the bHLH
motif and PAS domain (A) and phylogenetic tree constructed from the se-
quences of PAS regions (B). (A) Alignment of the sequences was done by the
method of Gotoh (24). Basic region (d), helix 1 (
), loop ((cid:104)), helix 2
), and two of the repeated sequences (s) in the PAS domain are shown
(
by the bars above the alignment. Completely conserved amino acids are indicated
by the single-letter code beneath the sequences, and conserved hydrophobic (o),
hydrophilic (j), small aliphatic (.), large aliphatic (@), aromatic ($), positive ((cid:49)),
and negative ( ) sites are also indicated. Amino acids identical to those of mouse
Arnt2 and mouse Sim are enclosed by solid lines and shadowed, respectively. (B)
The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the method of Saitou and Nei (41).
Sequences have been reported so far for human Arnt (28), mouse Arnt (39), rat
Arnt (3), Drosophila Per (29), human AhR (9, 12), mouse AhR (2, 13), rat AhR
(3), Drosophila Sim (7, 34), mouse Sim (14), and human Hif-1(cid:97) (48). Abbrevi-
ations: m, mouse; h, human; r, rat; d, Drosophila; PAM, accepted point mutations
per 100 sites.
