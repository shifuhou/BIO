Figure 2.
Hypoxia and HGF treatment activate the Akt signaling pathway and maintain MSC viability.
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were incubated for 16 hours in serum-free medium
exposed to hypoxic or normoxic conditions in the presence or absence of 25 ng/ml human
recombinant HGF. MSC were tested for expression of Akt and its activation by Western
blotting (A) and for viability by flow cytometry with Annexin V and propidium iodide
staining (C). Western blot densitometry (B) showed a significant increase in Akt
phosphorylation when cells were stimulated with hypoxia and HGF, whereas quantitation of
flow cytometry data (D) demonstrated no significant difference between the different
treatment groups, using the Student's t test. Shown are representative data of four (A) and
five (C) separate experiments. Abbreviations: HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; MSC,
mesenchymal stem cells.
