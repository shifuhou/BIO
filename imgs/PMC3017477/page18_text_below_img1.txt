Figure 4.
Hypoxia and HGF treatment do not significantly change the proliferation status of
mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). MSC were cultured in serum-free medium in hypoxic
versus normoxic conditions in the presence or absence of 25 ng/ml HGF. Cells were
collected, fixed, stained with PI, and analyzed with flow cytometry for cell cycle status.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting plots are representative results of five separate
experiments (A). The bar graph shows quantitation of flow cytometry data (B). Differences
were not significant, according to Student's t-test. Abbreviations: HGF, hepatocyte growth
factor; PI, propidium iodide.
