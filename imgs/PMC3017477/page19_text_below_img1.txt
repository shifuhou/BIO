Figure 5.
Hypoxia sensitizes human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) by elevating the levels of HGF
receptor cMet, thus increasing the ability of MSC to respond to HGF stimulation. MSC were
cultured in serum-free medium for 16 hours in hypoxic or normoxic conditions and then
collected to generate protein lysates, which were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE) gel and probed with cMet antibody (A). The bar graph represents
Western blot densitometry results, demonstrating significant increases in the levels of
mature cMet and its precursor in cells cultured in hypoxia (B). MSC were incubated in
hypoxic or normoxic conditions in serum-free medium for 24 hours. Cultures were
stimulated for 0, 15, or 30 minutes with 25 ng/ml HGF, and protein lysates were collected
and immunoprecipitated with cMet antibody. Protein was resolved on SDS-PAGE gel and
probed for anti-phosphotyrosine and cMet antibodies (C). The bar graph represents Western
blot densitometry results of phosphorylated cMet (D). Shown are representative results of
three (A, B) or four (C, D) separate experiments. Abbreviations: HGF, hepatocyte growth
factor; kD, kilodaltons.
