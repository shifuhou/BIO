Characterization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Human MSC were cultured from bone
marrow aspirates in complete medium. They were selected by adherence to plastic while
hematopoietic contamination was excluded by fluorescent-conjugated antibody staining of
the MSC for CD45 and CD34. The phenotypic markers CD105, CD90, and CD73 were
assessed by flow cytometry. (A): Representative plots of the fluorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis of unlabeled MSC. (B): Antibody-labeled samples. Assessment of the lack
of CD34 and CD45 was performed with all cell cultures used for Western blot experiments,
whereas three MSC cultures derived from three separate donors were analyzed for CD105,
CD90, and CD73. When cultured in defined differentiation medium, MSC differentiated
into the adipogenic lineage, shown here by oil red O stain (C), the osteogenic lineage,
shown by alizarin red stain (D), and the chondrogenic lineage, shown by Alcian Blue stain
(E). Abbreviations: APC, allophycocyanin; FL1, fluorescence channel 1, detecting FITC;
FL2, fluorescence channel 2, detecting PE; FL4, fluorescence channel 4, detecting APC; PE,
phycoerythrin.
