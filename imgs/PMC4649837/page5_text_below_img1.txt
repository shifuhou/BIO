Figure 3 Hypoxia-cultured primary human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs-H) retain a greater proliferation capacity compared with normoxia-cultured
primary hAMSCs (hAMSCs-N) when exposed to GBM media. hAMSCs-H maintain stem cell characteristics when exposed to GBM media. (a) Representative MRI of GBM from a
patient. (b) Schema showing the collection of GBM CM and culture of hAMSCs in filtered GBM CM for proliferation and migration assays. (c) MTT assay was used to determine
the effects of hypoxic conditions on the proliferative capacity of primary hAMSCs in GBM CM. In GBM CM, hAMSCs-H showed greater proliferation at day 10 and 15 compared
with hAMSCs-N. (d) Ki-67 immunostaining was performed to quantify the number of proliferating cells in GBM CM. Proliferative capacities of hAMSCs-H and hAMSCs-N are
shown in GBM CM (normalized to hAMSC-N proliferative capacity in control media). In GBM CM, hAMSCs-H had a greater proportion of proliferating cells than hAMSCs-N. (e)
Differentiation assay. hAMSCs were cultured in control media, differentiation media, and GBM CM for 3 weeks, 10 days after the second passage. Three stainings were performed
to assess the differentiation capabilities (scale bar, 100 Î¼m). Both hAMSCs-N and hAMSCs-H maintained tri-lineage differentiation capability in GBM CM. (f) Flow cytometric
analysis for CD31, CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90, and CD105 in hAMSC-N and hAMSC-H cultures after exposure to GBM CM for 20 days. hAMSCs-H maintained MSC phenotypic
markers in GBM CM (negative for CD31, CD34, and CD45, and positive for CD73, CD90, and CD105). Error bars represent S.E.M. Error bars represent S.E.M. *Po0.05,
**Po0.01, N.S., not significant
