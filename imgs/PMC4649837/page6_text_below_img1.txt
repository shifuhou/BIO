Figure 4 The hAMSC media promotes GBM differentiation in vitro. The proliferation and migration abilities of GBM remain unchanged in hAMSC media. In vivo, GBM cells
exposed to primary hAMSCs-H show increased differentiation into astrocytic lineage (increased GFAP levels and decreased Nestin levels). (a) MTTassay was used to determine
the effects of hAMSC media on the proliferative capacity of GBM. No difference in GBM proliferative capacity between hAMSC-H or hAMSC-N media and control media was
observed. (b) Ki-67 immunostaining was performed to quantify the number of proliferating GBM cells in hAMSC media. No difference in proportion of proliferating GBM cells was
found between control media, hAMSC-N CM, and hAMSC-H CM. (c) Immunostaining for Nestin, GFAP, and Tuj1 was performed on GBM cells in AMSC CM. (d–f) Quantification
of Nestin, GFAP, and Tuj1 markers for GBM cells in hAMSC CM. GBM showed greater differentiation in hAMSC-H CM than in control media as shown by decreased nestin,
increased GFAP, and increased Tuj1 expression. (g) Mice brain sections were immunostained for Nestin, GFAP, and Tuj1, to test the differentiation of GBM276 cells in vivo.
GBM276 cells in mice injected with hAMSCs-H showed greater differentiation toward an astrocytic lineage compared with those in mice injected with hAMSCs-N. Scale bars,
100 μm. (h–j) Quantification of GFAP+/human nuclei+, Nestin+, GFAP+, and Tuj1+ cells
