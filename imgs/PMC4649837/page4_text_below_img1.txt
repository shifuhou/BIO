Figure 2 Primary hAMSCs cultured in hypoxia grow faster, have higher viability, and can be passaged for more generations in vitro. (a) hAMSCs-H had shorter P1 and P2
passage times. The passage time of P0 was calculated once cells reached 80% confluence, after 2 g of fat tissue was digested and seeded at a density of 0.6 × 104/cm2 in hypoxic
or normoxic conditions separately. The passage time of P1 and P2 was determined when 80% confluence was achieved. (b) Passage doubling time assay. hAMSCs-H had a
constant PDT (o4 days) for up to 20 passages. PDT = τ Ln (2)/Ln (Nτ/N0), where τ = time from plating to counting the cells, Nτ = number of cells when counted and N0 = initial
number of cells. (c) MTTassay was used to determine the effects of hypoxia on the proliferative capacity of hAMSCs. (d and e) Ki-67 immunostaining was performed to quantify
the number of proliferating cells. Representative images (scale bar, 100 μm) and proliferating percentage of hAMSCs are shown. (f and g) Flow cytometric apoptosis analysis for
Annexin V–FITC-positive and PI-negative cells. Representative histograms and quantification are shown. (h and i) PI staining was used to test the cell cycle and necrosis
percentage of the cells. Representative histograms and quantification are shown. Error bars represent S.E.M. *Po0.05, **Po0.01, N.S., not significant
