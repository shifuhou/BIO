Figure 7 The tropism of primary hAMSCs-H to GBM CM in vitro and GBM in vivo is increased. (a) Schematic of a Boyden chamber transwell assay. (b and c) Representative
images and quantification graphs shown for a Boyden chamber transwell assay. hAMSCs (2 × 104) were seeded in the top well, while either GBM CM or control media was placed
in the bottom well. After 24-h incubation, cells on the bottom were stained and quantified. (d) Schematic of the in vivo experiment. (e) Mice brain sections were immunostained for
GFP and human nuclei to test the tropism of the primary hAMSCs for GBM276 tumor bulk in vivo. hAMSCs-H have enhanced tropism toward tumor bulk compared with hAMSCs-
N. Scale bars, 100 μm. (f) Quantification of percentage of GFP+/human nuclei+ cells per field. Error bars represent S.E.M. *Po0.05, **Po0.01, N.S., not significant
