Figure 7. A HAT inhibitor modulates chromatin structure and gene transcription in memory CD8
T cells
(A) High levels of gene expression were not associated with H3K4me3 but with H3K9ac in
the TNFRSF9 gene in memory CD8 T cell subsets.
(B) High levels of gene expression were associated with both H3K4me3 and H3K9ac in the
SLAMF1 gene in memory CD8 T cell subsets.
(C) Complete reductions in mRNA levels were associated with reductions in H3K9ac levels
alone in the TNFRSF9 gene with curcumin treatment in memory CD8 T cell subsets. Partial
reductions in mRNA levels were associated with reductions in H3K9ac levels but not
H3K4me3 levels in the SLAMF1 gene with curcumin treatment in memory CD8 T cell subsets.
