Figure 3. H3K27me3domains in naïve and memory CD8 T cells
(A) Enriched H3K27me3 regions in naïve CD8 T cells. The chromosomal locations, residing
gene loci, and their transcriptional orientations are shown (the scanning method for the
selection is discussed in the Experimental Procedures).
(B) One representative H3K27me3 island in naïve CD8 T cells.
(C) Enriched H3K27me3 regions in memory CD8 (TEM) T cells. The chromosomal locations,
residing gene loci, and their transcriptional orientations are shown.
(D) One representative H3K27me3 island in CD8 TEM cells.
