Figure 2. Global correlation between gene expression and histone methylation in CD8 T cell subsets
(A) The levels of gene expression were positively correlated with the levels of H3K4me3 in
naïve and memory CD8 T cells subsets at rest.
(B) The levels of gene expressions were negatively correlated with the levels of H3K27me3
in naïve and memory CD8 T cells subsets at rest. Each dot in the plots (A and B) represents
the mean value of 100 genes that were grouped based on their rank of mRNA level from the
highest to the lowest.
(C) The numbers of the genes with high levels of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 in naïve and memory
CD8 T cell subsets are shown.
