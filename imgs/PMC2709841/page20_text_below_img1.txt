Figure 5. Genes with bivalent chromatins in memory CD8 T cell subsets
(A) Genes with bivalent chromatins of TCM and/or TEM CD8 T cells are categorized by cellular
function (the criteria for the bivalent genes were described in the Results and Methods. A
complete list of bivalent genes can be found in Table S5).
(B) One representative common bivalent gene (MLK4) is shown with its gene locus and the
levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at resting in na√Øve and memory CD8 T cell subsets.
(C) Changes in the levels of H3K4me3 and mRNA expression in the MLK4 gene at 0 and 72
hours after anti-CD3/28 stimulation in CD8 TCM and TEM are shown. The mean values and
SEM are presented from 5 independent donors.
