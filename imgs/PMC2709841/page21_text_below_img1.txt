Figure 6. Differentially expressed genes are correlated with histone methylation in CD8 TCM and
TEM
(A) Differential gene expression profiles in TCM and TEM were analyzed by Agilent human
whole genome chip. Selected genes that differed between TCM and TEM by >3-fold are shown
(a complete list of genes can be found in Table S6).
(B) Differential gene expressions were positively correlated with the levels of H3K4me3 in
TCM and TEM. The significantly differentially expressed genes between TCM and TEM were
selected as described above and in the Experimental Procedures. The ratios of mRNA levels
between TCM and TEM were compared to the ratios of H3K4me3 levels between TCM and
TEM in their corresponding genes (N=137, R2=0.39). The Log10 values were used in the plot.
