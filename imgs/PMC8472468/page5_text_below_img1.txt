Figure 2. Effects of the HIF-1 activation on the tricarboxylic acid cycle and associated pathways,
including glutamine and citrate metabolism, in hypoxia. The mechanisms are highlighted in red,
and the red arrows indicate the direction of ﬂux via the metabolic pathways under the prevailing
oxygen tension. (A) In normoxia, pyruvate produced via glycolysis enters the mitochondria, where
it is converted to acetyl-CoA and enters the tri-carboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Citrate from the TCA
can be exported from the mitochondria into the cytosol, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA for
fatty acid synthesis. Cytosolic glutamine is converted to α-ketoglutarate and transported into the
mitochondria where it enters the TCA. A key regulator of autophagy, Beclin 1 is inhibited by Bcl-2
and Bcl-XL, thereby decreasing autophagy. (B) In hypoxia, HIF-1 activation results in increased ﬂux
through the glycolytic pathway, as well as accumulation of pyruvate and conversion into lactate.
BNIP3 and BNIP3L (not shown in this ﬁgure) are expressed under the control of HIF-1, which
then interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to liberate Beclin 1. Beclin 1 induces mitochondrial autophagy,
reducing the formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species under hypoxia. Fatty acid synthesis
is maintained by reductive carboxylation of glutamine, formation of citrate, and conversion of citrate
into acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm.
