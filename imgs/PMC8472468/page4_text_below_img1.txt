Figure 1. HIF-1 in normoxia and hypoxia. (A) In normoxia, HIF-1α is hydroxylated by prolyl
and asparaginyl hydroxylases in the cytoplasm in an oxygen-dependent manner. It then forms a
complex with VHL and other proteins, allowing it to be ubiquitnylated and degraded by proteosomes.
(B) In hypoxia, the lack of oxygen-dependent hydroxylation and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α
causes it to accumulate. It then translocates to the nucleus and complexes with HIF-1β to form a
transcription factor complex that binds to hypoxia response elements (HRE) within the promoter
regions of target genes involved in cell proliferation, metastasis, glycolysis, angiogenesis, growth,
and survival.
