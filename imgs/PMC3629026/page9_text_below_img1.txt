Figure 7. In vivo implantation results of hTSCs after culture in hypoxic and normaxic conditions. hTSCs grown under both hypoxic or
normaxic conditions were implanted into nude rats. Implantation of the cells embedded in ETM (ETM-5% O2) resulted in the formation of tendon-like
structures (A, triangles) compared to only spotty areas stained with human collagen type I (B, arrows) when hTSCs treated with 20% O2 and
embedded in the same ETM (ETM-20% O2) were implanted in vivo.
implantation of ETM-5% O2 hTSCs led to little formation of
adiponectin (E), collagen type II (I), and osteocalcin (M); in contrast, implantation of ETM-20% O2 hTSCs exhibited strong staining for collagen type II
(J, arrow) and osteocalcin (N, arrow). When hTSCs were treated with 5% O2 and embedded in Matrigel, implantation of the cell-Matrigel composites
formed more extensive tendinous (C, D, arrows) and non-tendinous tissues (G, green; K, red; O, red) compared to hTSCs treated with 20% O2 and
embedded in Matrigel (H, green; L, red; P, red). Red represents collagen type I (A–D); Green represents adiponectin (E–H); Red represents collagen
type II (I–L) and red represents osteocalcin (M–P). In all figures blue represents nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342. Scale bars: 100 mm.G.
