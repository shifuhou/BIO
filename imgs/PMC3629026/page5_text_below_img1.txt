Figure 2. Proliferation of hTSCs cultured under hypoxic and
normaxic culture conditions. hTSCs were grown in DMEM growth
medium with FBS under hypoxic or normaxic conditions and colony
formation was determined by counting cells stained with methyl violet.
While the cells grew at both culture conditions, at all time points (days
1, 2, 6, and 12), hTSCs at 5% O2 grew significantly quicker than at 20%
O2.
