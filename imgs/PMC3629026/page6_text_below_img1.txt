Figure 3. A. The expression of stem cell markers by hTSCs under hypoxic and normaxic culture conditions. hTSCs grown under hypoxic
or normaxic conditions were analyzed by immunocytochemistry using specific antibodies to determine stem cell marker expression (See materials
and methods for details). Compared to normaxic condition (20% O2), more hTSCs at hypoxic condition (5% O2) expressed nucleostemin (NS), Oct-4,
Nanog, and SSEA-4, all of which are known stem cell markers. Insets indicate NC proteins in the nuclei of hTSCs. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst
33342. Scale bars: 100 mm. B. Semi-quantification of stem cell markers by staining. hTSCs specifically stained for NS, Oct-4, Nanog and SSEA-4 by
immunocytochemical staining were counted to calculate percentage staining. As indicated, significantly higher percentages of hTSCs cultured under
5% O2 conditions expressed the stem cell markers (NS, Oct-4, Nanog, and SSEA-4) compared to those cultured under 20% O2 conditions (*P,0.05,
with respect to hTSCs under 20% O2 culture conditions). Scale bars: 100 mm.
