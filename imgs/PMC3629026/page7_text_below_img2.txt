Figure 5. A. Tenocyte related gene expression by hTSCs under
hypoxic and normaxic culture conditions. Total RNA extracted
from hTSCs grown under hypoxic or normaxic conditions was used to
synthesize cDNA, which was used as a template in qRT-PCR using
primers specific to Collagen-1 and Tenascin C. GAPDH was used as an
internal control. Y- axis represents relative gene expression when
compared to GAPDH expression levels. Ct values were normalized
against hTSCs cultured under 20% O2. At both oxygen conditions (5%
and 20% O2), there was no significant difference in the expression of
collagen type I, but the expression of tenascin C in the hypoxic group
was significantly higher than in the normaxic group (*P,0.05). B. Non-
tenocyte related gene expression by hTSCs under the above two
oxygen conditions. Total RNA extracted from hTSCs grown under
hypoxic or normaxic conditions was used to synthesize cDNA, which
was used as a template in qRT-PCR using primers specific to PPARc,
Sox-9 and Runx-2. GAPDH was used as an internal control. Y- axis
represents relative gene expression when compared to GAPDH
expression. Ct values were normalized against hTSCs cultured under
20% O2. The cellular expression of PPARc, a marker for adipogenesis,
was not significantly different in 5 and 20% O2 conditions. However,
Sox-9 and Runx-2 (markers for chondrogenesis and osteogenesis,
respectively) were expressed at significantly lower levels when hTSCs
were cultured at 5% O2 condition in comparison to 20% O2 (*P,0.05,
respective to hTSCs that were under normaxic conditions).
