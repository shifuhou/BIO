Figure 4. Stem cell gene analysis by qRT-PCR. Total RNA extracted
from hTSCs grown under hypoxic or normaxic conditions was used to
synthesize cDNA, which was used as a template in qRT-PCR using
primers specific to Oct-4 and Nanog. GAPDH was used as an internal
control. Y- axis represents relative gene expression when compared to
GAPDH expression levels. Ct values were normalized against hTSCs
cultured under 20% O2. Both stem cell marker genes (Oct-4 and Nanog)
cultured at 5% O2 culture conditions were expressed at significantly
higher g005levels than those cultured at 20% O2 culture conditions.
