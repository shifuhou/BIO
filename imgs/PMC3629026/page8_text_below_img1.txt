Figure 6. A. Multi-differentiation capacity of hTSCs under hypoxic and normaxic culture conditions. hTSCs were separately grown under
both hypoxic or normaxic conditions in adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic induction media for 21 days followed by staining with Oil red O for
adipogenesis, Safranin O for chondrogenesis and Alizarin red S for osteogenesis. It is apparent that compared to hTSCs at 20% O2 condition, cells
grown at 5% O2 culture condition formed more extensive lipids, proteoglycan accumulation, and calcium deposition, as revealed by Oil red O assay,
Safranin O assay, and Alizarin red S assay, respectively. Positively stained cells are indicated by arrows. Scale bars: 100 mm. B. Semi-quantification of
the staining results by three assays. Positively stained cells were counted to calculate percentage staining. More hTSCs at 5% O2 condition were found
to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes than hTSCs at 20% O2 condition (*P,0.05, with respect to hTSCs that were under
normaxic condition).
