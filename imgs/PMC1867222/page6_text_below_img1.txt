Figure 2. VEGF and VEGFR-2 in atrophic skeletal muscle cells in chronically ischemic human lower-limb muscle. aâ€“f: Serial sections from extensor digitorum
longus muscle of patient 3. a: (cid:1)-Actin immunostaining (HHF-35). b: As a demonstration of chronic ischemia, adipose cell (asterisks in all figures) and
macrophage infiltration (arrowheads) are associated with skeletal muscle atrophy (CD68 immunostaining). c and d: Atrophic (arrowheads) but not normal
skeletal muscle cells in the bottom right corner show immunostaining for VEGF (anti-VEGF from Santa Cruz) (c) and for VEGFR-2 immunostaining
(anti-VEGFR-2 from Santa Cruz) (d). Arrowheads indicate positive cells. e: More blood vessels (arrowheads) are seen in the area of atrophic muscle expressing
VEGF than in the region of normal muscle (CD31 immunostaining). f: Control immunostaining in which the first antibody was omitted. Scale bars, 100 (cid:2)m.
