Figure 3. Notch signal activation is required in endothelial cells.
The Rbpsuh gene was conditionally inactivated in the endothelial
cell lineage by crossing mice containing a floxed Rbpsuh allele
to mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the Tek
promoter. (a,b) Whole mounts of E9.5 embryos. (b) The Tek-Cre
Rbpsuhfl/null embryo exhibits growth retardation and pericardial
effusion. (c,d) PECAM-1-stained E9.5 embryos and yolk sacs. (d) The
Tek-Cre Rbpsuhfl/null mutant yolk sac has failed to remodel the
primary vascular plexus to form large vitelline blood vessels. (e,f)
Sections of PECAM-1-stained E9.5 embryos. The dorsal aortae (ar-
rows) of the Tek-Cre Rbpsuhfl/null mutant are reduced in diameter.
