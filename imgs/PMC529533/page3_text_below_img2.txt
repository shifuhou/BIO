Figure 4. Arteriovenous malformations in Notch pathway mutant
embryos. India ink was injected into the proximal outflow tract of
the heart in order to visualize blood flow and arteriovenous malfor-
mations. (a,d) In wild-type embryos, ink injected into the heart ex-
ited through the branchial arch arteries, entered the paired dorsal
aortae, and traversed the entire length of the embryo. In Dll4+/− (b,e)
and Tek-Cre Rbpsuhfl/null (c,f) embryos, injected ink exited the distal
outflow tract, then entered the venous circulation via small-diam-
eter anastamoses with the anterior cardinal vein. The Dll4+/− and
Tek-Cre Rbpsuhfl/null embryos shown in b and c are different em-
bryos than those shown in e and f. (a–c) Low-magnification views.
(d–f) High-magnification views.
