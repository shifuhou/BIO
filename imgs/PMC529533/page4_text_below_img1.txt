Figure 5. Histological analysis of arteriovenous malformations in
Notch pathway mutants. (a–c) Sections of wild-type, Dll4+/− and
Tek-Cre Rbpsuhfl/null PECAM-1-stained embryos at E9.5. (d,e) Higher-
magnification views of the embryos in b and c. In each mutant, an
arteriovenous malformation (arrowhead) consisting of a small-
diameter anastomosis connecting the cardinal vein (CV) with the
dorsal aorta (DA) can be observed. (f,g) Sections of wild-type and
Rbpsuh−/− PECAM-1-stained embryos at E9.5. (g) The mutant em-
bryo exhibits an arteriovenous malformation (arrowhead) caused by
the fusion of the dorsal aorta with the common cardinal vein (CCV).
