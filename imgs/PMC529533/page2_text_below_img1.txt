Figure 1. Vascular defects in Dll4+/− embryos. PECAM-1-stained
yolk sacs (a,b) and embryos (c,d) at E9.5. (b) The Dll4+/− mutant yolk
sac has failed to remodel the primary vascular plexus to form the
large vitelline blood vessels. (d) The vascular network in the Dll4+/−
embryo appears less intricate and more primitive than the capillary
(e,f) Histological sections of
network of the control littermate.
PECAM-1-stained E9.5 embryos at the level of the otic vesicle (as-
terisk). (f) The dorsal aorta of this Dll4+/− embryo is reduced in di-
ameter (arrowhead) on one side and is atretic (i.e., contains no lu-
men) on the other side (arrow).
