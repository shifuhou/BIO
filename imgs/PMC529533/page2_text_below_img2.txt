Figure 2. Vascular defects and loss of arterial marker expression in
Rbpsuh−/− embryos. (a–d) PECAM-1-stained E9.5 embryos and yolk
sacs. (b) The Rbpsuh−/− embryo exhibits severe growth retardation
and a very primitive vascular network. (d) The Rbpsuh−/− yolk sac
exhibits no vascular remodeling. (e–h) Efnb2-tau-lacZ expression in
E9.5 embryos and yolk sacs. In the wild-type embryo, Efnb2-tau-
lacZ is expressed in the dorsal aorta (arrow) and intersomitic arteries
of the embryo (e) and the vitelline arteries of the yolk sac (g). Ex-
pression is also observed in somites, nephrogenic mesoderm, bran-
chial arches and hindbrain. Arterial Efnb2-tau-lacZ expression is
lost in the Rbpsuh−/− embryo (f) and yolk sac (h). (i–l) Whole mount
immunohistochemistry of E9.5 embryos. CD44 (i,j) and (cid:1)SMA (k,l)
expression in the dorsal aorta (arrow) of wild-type embryos is down-
regulated in Rbpsuh−/− embryos.
