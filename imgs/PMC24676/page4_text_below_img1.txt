FIG. 2. Human SRCs are exclusively CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:50). (A) Representative Southern blot analysis of individual NOD(cid:121)SCID mice transplanted with
CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:50), CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:49), and CD34(cid:50) cells from CB. DNA was extracted from the murine bone marrow 8 weeks after the transplant and
hybridized with a human chromosome 17-specific (cid:97)-satellite probe. (B) Summary of the level of human cell engraftment in the BM of mice
transplanted with purified cell fractions from 14 CB (solid circles) and two BM (open circles) samples. Numbers indicate the dose of CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:50)
cells transplanted. Up to 60,000 CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:49) cells and 400,000 CD34(cid:50) cells were transplanted.
