FIG. 1. Purification of CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:50), CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:49), and CD34(cid:50) cell subsets. (A) Schematic diagram depicting the strategy used to obtain
highly purified cells. Light density mononuclear cells from whole CB or BM were separated into lineage negative (Lin(cid:50)) or positive (Lin(cid:49)) fractions
by staining with monoclonal antibodies against lineage antigens, followed by purification on an immunomagnetic column (StemSep). Lin(cid:50) cells
were stained with monoclonal antibodies specific for CD34 and CD38 and sorted on a FACStar Plus cell sorter into CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:50) and CD34(cid:49)
CD38(cid:49) populations. Lin(cid:49) cells were stained with anti-CD34 and sorted for the CD34(cid:50) population. (B) Expression of CD34 and CD38 on
mononuclear cord blood cells analyzed by flow cytometry. The CD34(cid:49) cells that also express CD38 make up 0.5% of the cells in the lymphocyte(cid:121)blast
window (R1 in C), whereas 0.1% are CD38 negative. (C) Forward and side scatter plot of Lin(cid:50) cells showing the live gate (R1) used for flow
cytometry. (D) Dot plot showing that Lin(cid:50) cells are highly enriched for both CD34(cid:49) and CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:50) cells. (E) Histogram of CD34 expression
on Lin(cid:50) cells. R2 represents the flow cytometry sorting gate used to purify CD34(cid:49) cells. (F) Histogram of CD38 expression on Lin(cid:50) cells. R3 and
R4 represent the gates used to sort CD38(cid:50) and CD38(cid:49) cells. (G) Histogram of CD34 expression on Lin(cid:49) cells. R5 indicates the gate used to select
CD34(cid:50) cells (H and I). Flow cytometric reanalysis of CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:49) (H), CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:50) (I), and CD34(cid:50) (J) sorted cell fractions. Purities are
given as a percentage of the cells in the particular lymphocyte(cid:121)blast window.
