FIG. 3. Multilineage differentiation of human CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:50) cells in NOD(cid:121)SCID mice. Bone marrow from a highly engrafted mouse
transplanted with 5,000 CD34(cid:49) CD38(cid:50) CB cells was stained with various human-specific monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry.
(A) Histogram of CD45 (pan-leukocyte marker) expression indicating that 35% of the cells present in the murine bone marrow are human. (B)
Analysis of lineage markers was done on cells within gate R1 (CD45(cid:49)). (C) Cells in R1 were further gated based on forward and side scatter
properties into lymphoid (R2), blast (R3) and myeloid (R4) windows. (D) Isotype control for nonspecific IgG staining of PE and FITC fluorescence.
(Eâ€“I) Expression of the following markers is shown: E, myeloid marker CD33 and monocytic marker CD14 (R3 and R4); F, myeloid marker CD13
and mature granulocyte marker CD15 (R3 and R4); G, pan-B cell markers CD19 and CD20 (R2 and R3); H, CD19 and mature B cell marker sIgM
(R2 and R3); I, CD38 and the immature hematopoietic marker CD34 on cells from R2, R3, and R4.
