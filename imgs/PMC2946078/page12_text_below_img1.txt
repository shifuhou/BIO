Figure 2. Generation of hepatocytes from human ES cells
A) Flow diagram outlining the procedure used to control hepatocyte differentiation. B)
Hepatocyte differentiation from huES cells was monitored by immunocytochemistry at day
0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 using antibodies that recognized OCT3/4, FOXA2, SOX17, GATA4,
HNF4a, Alphafetoprotein (AFP), and Albumin. Results are representative of three
independent differentiation experiments. C) Albumin secretion by huES cell–derived
hepatocytes was identified after 3–days of culture in medium by ELISA. D) Representative
flow cytometry profile showing the average number of Albumin positive hepatocytes in
three independent differentiation experiments = 80.9%±0.75. E) hES cell–derived
hepatocytes were shown to store glycogen by PAS staining (a); store lipids by Oil Red O
staining (b); to display hepatocyte morphology including bi-nucleated cells (black arrow)
(c); efficiently uptake LDL using Dil-LDL (d); metabolize indocyanine green (e); and
localize dichlorofluorescein diacetate to their plasma membranes (white arrow) (f). F) Heat
map of gene array analyses demonstrating that a series of 40 mRNAs that are solely
expressed in livers 23 were increased (red=high, blue=low) following differentiation (Hep)
compared with undifferentiated (ES) cells.
