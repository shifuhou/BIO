Figure 3. Differentiation of hepatocytes from human iPS cells
A) Hepatocyte differentiation from hiPS cells was followed by detecting OCT3/4, FOXA2,
SOX17, GATA4, HNF4a, Alphafetoprotein (AFP), and Albumin (ALB) by
immunocytochemistry at day 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 days. Results are representative of three
independent differentiation experiments. B) Representative flow cytometry profile showing
the average number of Albumin positive hiPS–derived hepatocytes in three independent
differentiation experiments = 81.0%±4.8. C) Albumin secretion by hiPS cell–derived
hepatocytes was identified in the medium after 3–days of culture using ELISA. D)
Hepatocyte–like cells derived from hiPS cells were shown to store glycogen by PAS
staining (a); store lipids by Oil Red O staining (b); uptake LDL using Dil-LDL (c); and
metabolize indocyanine green (d); have similar morphology to hepatocytes with some cells
being bi-nucleated (black arrow) (e); and direct dichlorofluorescein diacetate to plasma
membranes (white arrow) (f). E) Heat map of gene array analyses showing that expression
of 40 liver–specific mRNAs 23 was increased (red) following differentiation (Hep)
compared with undifferentiated (hiPS) cells where the majority of these mRNAs were
expressed at relatively low levels (blue). F) Bar graphs showing the levels of mRNAs,
determined by real-time qRT-PCR, encoding Phase I and II enzymes in hepatocyte–like
cells derived from H9 huES cells (yellow) and C2 hiPS cells (orange) expressed as fold of
levels found in cadaveric human liver samples.
