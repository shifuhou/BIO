Figure 4. Integration of huES and hiPS cell–derived hepatocytes into the mouse hepatic
parenchyma
A) Micrographs showing the identification of cells expressing human Albumin (brown) in
human livers (upper right) and in mouse livers injected with huES cell– (lower left) and
hiPS cell–derived (lower right) hepatocytes but not in uninjected control mouse livers (top
right). B) PCR analyses using primers that specifically recognize human Alu or mouse
HPRT sequences on genomic DNA isolated from control mouse and human fibroblasts as
well as cells collected by laser capture from sections through mouse liver, human tonsil, and
albumin positive cells from mouse livers injected with huES cell– or hiPS cell–derived
hepatocyes. Amplifications performed without template ensured the absence of
contaminating DNA.
