Figure 1. Fetal livers derived from mouse iPS cells
A) Brightfield (top) and fluorescent (bottom) images of CAG-eGFP+/− (eGFP), eGFP
negative (CD1), and iPS cell–derived (eGFP:iPS 13) E12.5 embryos. B) Brightfield and
fluorescent images of CAG-eGFP+/−(eGFP;left), eGFP-negative (CD1;right), and iPS cell-
derived E12.5 fetal livers (eGFP:iPS 13). C) Whole mount images of E14.5 embryos (top)
and their livers (middle) derived from wild-type (CD-1) and iPS cells (iPS 13). Bottom
panels show hematoxylin and eosin stained sections through control (CD-1) and iPS cell–
derived (iPS 13) E14.5 livers. D) Immunohistochemistry revealing marker expression in
hepatocytes (HNF4a), endothelial cells (GATA4), sinusoidal cells (Lyve-1), and
macrophages/Kupffer cells (F4/80) in control (CD-1) and iPS cell–derived (iPS 13) E14.5
livers. Scale bars = 100μm. E) RT-PCR analyses of two control (CD-1) and iPS–derived
(iPS 13) E14.5 livers showing steady levels of characteristic liver mRNAs as well as
neomycin phosphotransferase II mRNA, which is only expressed in iPS cell-derived livers.
RNA polymerase II mRNA (Pol2ra) was used as a loading control, and reactions without
reverse transcriptase (−RT) or template (0) confirmed the absence of contaminating DNA.
