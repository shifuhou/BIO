Figure 3 (a) mRNA expression of HIFs in hES cells at 5% and 20% oxygen. All data have been normalised to UBC and to 1 for 20% oxygen. *P!0.05
signiﬁcantly different to 20% oxygen (nZ3). (b) Representative western blots of HIFs after long-term culture at 5% or 20% oxygen (C) represents
positive control protein. (c) Quantiﬁcation of HIF western blots. Data were normalised to b-actin and to 1 for 20% oxygen. *P!0.05 signiﬁcantly
different to 20% oxygen (nZ3). (d) Protein expression of HIFs by immunocytochemistry in hES cells cultured under 5% oxygen for 48 h (5% 48 h;
A and B, G and H, M and N), 5% oxygen for long-term (5% LTZmore than three passages; C and D, I and J, O and P, S and T) and 20% oxygen
(E and F, K and L, Q and R, U and V). HIF1A (green; A–F), HIF2A (green; G–L), HIF3 (red; M–R) and HIF1A (green; S–V). DAPI (blue). Negative
