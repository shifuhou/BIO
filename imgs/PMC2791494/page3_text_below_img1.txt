Figure 1 (a) Phase contrast images of Hues 7 hES colonies cultured on MEFs under 5% (A, C and E) and 20% (B, D and F) oxygen on days 2 (A and B),
3 (C and D) and 4 (E and F) post-passage. Area of differentiation highlighted with arrow. Scale bar, 500 mm. (b) Average maximum hES cell colony
diameter at 5 and 20% oxygen on days 2–4 post-passage **P!0.01, ***P!0.001 signiﬁcantly different from 5% oxygen (nZ6 for each day).
(c) Average hES cell number at 5% and 20% oxygen on days 1–4 post-passage. Cell numbers were normalised on day 0 by passaging equal numbers
of cells under both oxygen tensions. ***P!0.001 signiﬁcantly different from 5% oxygen (nZ21 for each day). (d) Ki67 (green) and DAPI (blue)
labelling of Hues 7 hES cells at 5% (A–C) and 20% (D–F) oxygen on day 3 post-passage, phase contrast (C and F). Negative control, secondary
antibody only (G). Scale bar, 250 mm.
