colony size of double knockdown combinations of
HIF1A and HIF2A or HIF1A and HIF3A or the triple
knockdown due to the absence of colony formation
occurring in these populations. Virtually all cells were
positive for Ki67 when either HIF1A or HIF3A expression
was silenced whereas Ki67 expression decreased to
w85% when HIF2A was knocked down (P!0.001,
Fig. 7c and d).
