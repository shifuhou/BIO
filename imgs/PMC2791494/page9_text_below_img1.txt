hypoxic response (Mazure et al. 2004). However, our
data suggests this is not the case, at least in hES cells
since HIF1A was only transiently expressed in the
nucleus for w48 h following exposure to hypoxia.
These Ô¨Åndings are in agreement with recent data from
Cameron et al. (2008) using a 2% environmental oxygen
tension, although contrary to those of Westfall et al.
(2008), who found HIF1A protein to be expressed in hES
cells after 10 days of culture under both 5 and 20%
oxygen. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown
although HIF1A would be expected to be rapidly
degraded by PHDs under atmospheric conditions.
Moreover, the HIF1A staining observed by the latter
investigators was cytoplasmic and therefore would not
be expected to regulate the expression of hypoxia
regulated genes. Our study suggests that HIF1A may
play a role in the initial adaptation of hES cells to hypoxia
factor(s) must be responsible for
but some other
maintaining the hypoxic response. We propose that
HIF2A or HIF3A, both of which are translocated from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus and are upregulated following
