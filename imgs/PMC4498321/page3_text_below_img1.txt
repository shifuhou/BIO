Figure 2. Changes in the O2 and CO2  concentrations in the hypoxial  culture 
jar. Changes in O2 and CO2 concentrations in the (A) CulturePal-Zero and (B) 
represent  O2 
Culture-Pal-Five  hypoxial 
concentration;  triangles  represent  CO2  concentration.  Values  are  presented 
as mean of four independent experiments.
