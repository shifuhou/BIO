Figure  5.  Cell  viability  at  different  O2  concentrations  (A)  Representative 
images  from  the  LIVE/DEAD  viability  assay.  Live  cells  display  green 
fluorescence, while the dead cells appear red in color. (B) Percentage of cell 
viability  seen  at  different  O2  conditions.  Values  are  presented  as  mean  Â± 
standard deviation (n = 16 views/group; *P < 0.05).
