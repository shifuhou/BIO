Expansion and division history of BM cells after 4 days in culture in
hypoxia or normoxia. Lin–CD34+ and Lin–CD34+CD38– cells were cul-
tured in serum-free conditions for 4 days in the presence of IL-3, IL-6,
SCF, Flt-3 ligand, and G-CSF. (a) Expansion. The fold increase in cell
number relative to the initial cell number plated (day 0) is represent-
ed  for  each  subpopulation  cultured  in  normoxia  (white  bars)  or
hypoxia (black bars). *P < 0.05. (b) Division history of primitive sub-
populations of Lin–CD34+ cells. Freshly isolated Lin–CD34+ cells were
labeled with CFSE, cultured for 4 days in hypoxia (1.5% O2) or nor-
moxia, and analyzed for CFSE fluorescence intensity and expression
of markers associated with primitive progenitors and stem cells. His-
tograms (representative of three separate experiments) of CFSE fluo-
rescence in various Lin–CD34+ cell subsets are shown after 4 days of
culture in hypoxia (solid lines) or normoxia (dashed lines). Day 0 CFSE
fluorescence intensity is indicated by an arrow on each histogram.
