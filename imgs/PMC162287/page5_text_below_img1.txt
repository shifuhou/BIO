Effect of hypoxia on BM progenitor activity. The CFC (a) and LTC-IC
(b) activity of BM Lin–CD34+CD38– cells was evaluated before (day
0; white bars) and after culture for 4 days under normoxic (gray bars)
or hypoxic (1.5% O2; black bars) conditions. Data shown represent
the number (mean ± SD) of BFU-E (E), granulocyte (G), monocyte
(M), granulocyte-monocyte (GM), mixed (MIX, i.e., GM colonies
with erythroid cells), and total number of colonies from three sepa-
rate experiments. The paired Student t test was performed to com-
pare day 0 with day 4 cells (*P < 0.05) and to compare hypoxic to
normoxic conditions after 4 days of culture (†P < 0.05).
