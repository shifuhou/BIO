Figure 3
Quantitative analysis of the effect of hypoxia on SRC frequency. The
frequency of SRCs in freshly isolated Lin–CD34+CD38– cells (a, day
0) or cells cultured for 4 days under normoxic (b) or hypoxic (1.5%
O2) (c) conditions was determined by limiting dilution analysis. For
each NOD/SCID mouse (n = 88), the level of human engraftment
(percentage of CD45+ cells) is represented as a function of the num-
ber of Lin–CD34+CD38– cells transplanted. (d) Representative flow
cytometry dot plot showing the presence of both human myeloid
(CD33+) and lymphoid (CD19+) cells in NOD/SCID BM 6–8 weeks
after transplantation.
