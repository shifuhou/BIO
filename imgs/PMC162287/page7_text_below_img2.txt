Hypoxia regulates the expression of HIF target genes in BM progeni-
tors and stem cells. (a) Representative histograms of cell surface
expression of angiogenic and hematopoietic cytokine receptors in BM
Lin–CD34+ cells after 4 days in culture under normoxic (dashed lines)
or hypoxic (1.5% O2, solid lines) conditions. (b) The conditioned
medium from BM Lin–CD34+ cells cultured overnight in normoxia or
hypoxia (1.5% O2) was assayed for lactate and human VEGF. Bars rep-
resent the fold increase in lactate and VEGF concentrations measured
in hypoxic cultures relative to normoxic conditions. Error bars show
SD. (c) Effect of VEGF, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), and angiopoietin-2
(Ang-2) on cell surface expression of VEGFR2 in Lin–CD34+ cells after
4 days in culture under normoxic conditions (N).
