FIG. 1. Expression of E-cadherin is down-regulated in CC-RCC and correlates with VHL status. (A) 105 CC-RCC tumor samples and 12
normal kidney tissue samples were analyzed using Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip oligonucleotide arrays. Mean E-cadherin expression and
standard error were calculated, and a two-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine statistical signiﬁcance between the two groups. (B) Im-
munohistochemical staining of a representative CC-RCC with anti-E-cadherin and anti-VHL antibodies. Note the negative staining of the tumor
cells (upper right in each image) with each marker, in contrast to the positive staining shown by core tubule epithelium in the adjacent nontumor
renal cortex (lower left in each image) (original magniﬁcation, (cid:8)50). (C) TMAs containing 56 CC-RCC were immunostained with anti-VHL and
anti-E-cad antibodies. The slides were then scanned using Aperio ScanScope and scored blind by two independent observers as being either
positive or negative. Tumor cores meeting the quality standard criteria (see Materials and Methods) were considered for the correlation analysis
(bar graph). Representative cores of CC-RCC on TMAs stained with anti-VHL and anti-E-cadherin antibodies are shown where the top row
depicts a representative core showing negative staining for VHL and E-cadherin and the bottom row depicts a representative core showing positive
staining for VHL and E-cadherin. Tumor morphology and classiﬁcation were assessed using standard hematoxylin and eosin staining.
