FIG. 2. Loss of VHL results in down-regulation of E-cadherin. (A) VHL(cid:6)/(cid:6) 786-O and RCC4 cells stably expressing wild-type VHL or empty
plasmid (MOCK) were lysed, equal amounts of total cellular lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the indicated
antibodies. Anti-(cid:2)-tubulin immunoblotting was performed as an internal loading control. (B) Expression of E-cadherin was measured by
quantitative real-time PCR in 786-MOCK and 786-VHL cells and normalized to U1AsnRNP1 mRNA level. The E-cadherin level in 786-VHL cells
was arbitrarily set to 1.0. Error bars represent standard deviations of the relative increases in expression between the indicated cell types over three
independent experiments. (C) Endogenous VHL in HEK293A cells was knocked down using VHL-speciÔ¨Åc siRNA or scrambled nontargeting
control siRNA. RNA was then extracted for cDNA synthesis and endogenous transcript levels of VHL, E-cadherin, and U1AsnRNP1 measured.
Error bars represent standard deviations of the relative increases between the expression of the indicated mRNA relative to its expression using
control siRNA (arbitrarily set to 1.0) over three independent experiments.
