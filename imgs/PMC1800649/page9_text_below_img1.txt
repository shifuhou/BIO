FIG. 5. VHL-mediated transcription of E-cadherin is attenuated by Snail and SIP1 via the conserved E2 boxes. (A) Expression levels of
E-cadherin, Snail, SIP1, VEGF, and GLUT-1 were measured by quantitative real-time PCR in 786-MOCK and 786-VHL cells and normalized to
U1AsnRNP1 mRNA expression. Solid bars represent expression of the indicated mRNA in 786-MOCK cells relative to its expression in 786-VHL
cells, which was arbitrarily set to 1.0. (B) Dual-luciferase assays were performed in U2OS cells transfected with the indicated expression plasmids.
The ﬁreﬂy luciferase construct (E-cad prom-luc) was driven by the human E-cadherin promoter sequence (WT) or the promoter with point
mutations in both E2 boxes (mutE2). Cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase was used as an internal transfection control, and the ﬁreﬂy
luciferase RLUs were normalized against Renilla luciferase RLUs. Experiments and transfections were performed in triplicate with one repre-
sentative experiment presented. Error bars represent standard deviations. (C) The experiment was performed as described in panel B with
increasing concentrations of Snail and SIP1 individually mixed into HA-VHL transfection reactions at a ratio of 1:2, 2:2, and 4:2 (Snail or
SIP1:HA-VHL) or equal quantities of SIP1 and Snail combined into HA-VHL transfection reactions at a ratio of 1:1 (Snail and SIP1:HA-VHL).
Relative increases in induction (n-fold) were standardized to the E-cad prom-luc activity in the absence of exogenous VHL.
