Both  clonai  and  enriched  cultures  of primary  myoblasts 
displayed remarkable proliferation potential.  Pure myoblast 
cultures from several mouse strains have been expanded be- 
yond 40 population doublings,  and some clonai cultures have 
been expanded beyond 50 population doublings  (>10 ~  cells 
per clone).  There were no detectable changes of growth rate 
or  cell  morphology  even  after  extensive  proliferation  in 
vitro.  Because of the  extraordinary  growth  potential  of pri- 
mary  myoblasts  under  these  culture  conditions,  the  trans-
