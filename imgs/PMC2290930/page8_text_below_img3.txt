Figure  7.  Comparison  of primary  and  C2  myoblast transplants. 
Cloned primary myoblasts and C2 myoblasts, both labeled with the 
fl-gal marker, were transplanted into muscles of athymic mice, and 
the muscles were analyzed for fl-gal positive fibers at different times 
thereafter. Both panels are from muscles examined six weeks after 
transplantation.  (a) Primary myoblast transplant: nearly all of the 
fl-gal positive cells  are normal  caliber  fibers.  A  single small di- 
ameter fiber in this field is indicated by the arrow. (b) C2 myoblast 
transplant:  A majority  of fl-gal-labeled cells were fibers of small 
diameter  and intensely stained  for fl-gai activity (arrows). These 
small fibers most likely arose from C2 myoblasts fusing with each 
other. Bar,  15/~m.
