Figure L Myogenic enrichment by selective growth conditions. Pri- 
mary  cultures  from  muscle  of neonatal C57  mice  were  grown  in 
medium with either F-10 or DME as the nutrient mixture. After two 
weeks of growth and several passages,  one dish of each  was  fixed 
and stained with an antibody to desrnin to  identify myogenic cells 
and  with  HOECHST  nuclear  stain to  identify all cells.  A  single 
field is shown for cells in F-10 (a,  c,  and e) or DME  (b, d,  and f ) ,  
and each is photographed to show morphology (a and b: phase con- 
tras0,  total  cell  number (c  and d:  HOECHST nuclear stain) and 
myogenic cells (e andfi  desmin staining). Cultures grown in F-10 
were  highly  enriched  for  myogenic cells,  here  100%,  whereas  a 
minority of ceils grown  in DME  were  myogenic. The  three  myo- 
genic cells in the DME panels are indicated by arrows. Bar, 50 #m.
