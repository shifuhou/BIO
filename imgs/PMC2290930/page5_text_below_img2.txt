Figure 2. Retroviral labeling of primary myoblasts. (a) Cloned my- 
oblasts were infected with the BAG virus,  selected by addition of 
G418 to the growth medium, and then stained with X-gal to deter- 
mine the percentage of cell expressing fl-gal (cells with a blue reac- 
tion product).  M6re than 95 % of the cells were fl-gal positive. A 
cell not expressing fl-gal is indicated by the arrow. (b) Retrovirally 
labeled myoblasts were induced to differentiate in vitro by growth 
in low serum  medium.  Even after cloning, expansion in culture, 
retroviral infection, and selection, the cells readily differentiated to 
form linear and branching multinucleated myotubes, fl-gal staining 
shows persistent expression of the transgene in differentiated cells.
