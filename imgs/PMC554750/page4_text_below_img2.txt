Colony morphology and hCG expression after culture of H1 cells
under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 12 days. (A) Immunoﬂuores-
cent localization of hCG(cid:4) (green) (Upper) and brightﬁeld images (Lower) of
the H1 cell colonies (passage 50) cultured under normoxic (Left) or hypoxic
(Right) conditions for 12 days. d, differentiated area; u, undifferentiated area;
*, transition zone where cells pile up and express hCG(cid:4). (Bar, 0.5 mm.) (B)
Immunolocalization of hCG(cid:4) (green) (Left) and corresponding Hoechst nu-
clear staining (Right) in a colony cultured under hypoxic conditions for 12 days.

nuclear staining by Hoechst 33258 (blue) (Right) in the H1 cell colonies
(passage 50) cultured under normoxic (Upper) and hypoxic (Lower) conditions
for 12 days. (Bar, 25 (cid:3)m.)
