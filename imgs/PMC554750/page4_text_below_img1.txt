Fig. 3. Differentiation of hES cell colonies as determined by immunohisto-
chemical and biochemical analysis. (A–D) Detection of hCG(cid:4) by immunoﬂu-
orescence (green) (A and C) and of nuclei by Hoechst 33258 (white) (B and D)
in the H1 cells cultured under normoxic (A and B) or hypoxic (C and D)
conditions for 12 days. The photographs encompass areas of overt differen-
tiation (d), which have fewer nuclei and, hence, show less ﬂuorescence with
Hoechst dye than the areas appearing undifferentiated (u). CG(cid:4) signals
(green) (A and C) are largely conﬁned to cells in the ‘‘transition zone’’ between
the overtly differentiated areas and the more uniform, undifferentiated
areas. (Bar, 100 (cid:3)m.) (E) The mean daily production of hCG by H1 cells from ﬁve
independent experiments carried out at passages 30, 31, 32, 36, and 50 under
normoxic or hypoxic culture. Values are means (cid:3) SEM for 15 independent
determinations (n (cid:6) 3 for each experiment). Values that differ signiﬁcantly are
shown with asterisks (***, P (cid:4) 0.001; **, P (cid:4) 0.01; *, P (cid:4) 0.05). (F) The mean
daily production of P4 from four wells in two independent experiments
(passages 30 and 31). Values that differ signiﬁcantly (P (cid:4) 0.05) are shown with
an asterisk. (G) The mean daily production of AFP from the same ﬁve inde-
pendent experiments described in E. No signiﬁcant differences were observed
between normoxic and hypoxic conditions on any of the days of culture, and
the production levels were much lower than those observed in H9 cells (1) as
indicated (■
