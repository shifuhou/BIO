hormone production of hES colonies maintained under normoxic or hypoxic
conditions before passage. H1 cells (p31) that were cultured under normoxic
or hypoxic conditions for 13 days were subcultured 1:2. (A) The general
morphologies of the colonies are presented. d, differentiated areas within
colonies; u, undifferentiated areas; *, areas in the transition zones where cells
appear to be forming multilayers. (Bar, 1 mm.) (B) Relative areas of overt
differentiation were calculated relative to total colony area. Values in columns
are means (cid:3) SEM for 12–14 colonies from two separate wells per treatment.
Black bars show total colony size. Colored bars (NN, blue; HN, pink; NH, azure;
HH, red) reﬂect differentiated areas. (C and D) Daily amounts of hCG(cid:4)and P4
produced by the cells.
