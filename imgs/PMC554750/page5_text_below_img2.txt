Fig. 6.
EB formation after culture under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. EB
bodies were produced from cells (passage 40; (cid:1)2 (cid:2) 106 cells per well) that had
been continuously passaged under hypoxic (Upper) or normoxic (Lower)
conditions for (cid:1)4 months. (A and E) EB on days 4 and 5. (B and F) EB on days
8 and 9. (Bar, 0.4 mm.) (C and D) Cystic bodies (C) and attached EB cell explants
(D) derived from cells that had been maintained under hypoxic conditions at
day 17. (Bar, 0.2 mm.)
