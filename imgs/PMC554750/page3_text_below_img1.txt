Fig. 2. Morphologies of H1 cell colonies cultured under either normoxic or
increasingly hypoxic conditions. The H1 cells (passage 36) were cultured under
1%, 3%, or 21% O2, respectively, for 15 days, and representative colonies were
photographed at days 8, 12, and 15 with a 4(cid:2) objective under darkÔ¨Åeld
illumination. Differentiated areas appear darker than the more uniform,
surrounding regions of undifferentiated ES cells. (Bars, 1 mm.)
