Fig. 6. HIF-1–activated monocytes promote angiogenesis in matrigel and
improve blood flow in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. (A) Immuno-
staining of matrigel implanted in WT mice that had been admixed with
100,000 monocytes isolated from WT (WT mono) or Vhl mutant (Vhl mono)
mice for CD31 and CD11b. (Scale bar: 100 μm.) Area densities of CD31 and
CD11b in matrigel are shown (Right). ***P < 0.001 determined by Student t
test (n = 6 per group). (B) Laser Doppler flowmetry analysis of the blood
perfusion in the femoral artery ligated WT animals injected intramuscularly
with 50,000 monocytes isolated from WT mice (WT + WT mono) or Vhl mutant
mice (WT + Vhl mono). The data are the mean ± SEM (n = 6 for WT + WT
mono; n = 7 for WT + Vhl mono). Representative laser Doppler image from
each group is shown (Lower). (C) Immunostaining of the quadrate muscle at
day 14 for CD31 (Left) or CD11b (Right). ***P < 0.001 determined by unpaired
Student t test. (Scale bars: 100 μm.) Data in A–C are the mean ± SEM.
