Fig. 5. VEGF and S100A8 act cooperatively to promote neovascularization
in matrigel. (A) Matrigel immunostained for CD31 (red) implanted in Vhl
mutant or Vhl/Vegf double mutant mice. Quantification of CD31 area den-
sities are shown in the bar graph (n = 5 per group). (B) Western blot (Left)
showing Hif-1α, Vegf, S100A8 protein levels in sorted monocytes obtained
from Vhl or Vhl/Vegf mutant mice. qRT-PCR for Vegf (Center) was performed
in these mice and quantified as fold changes compared with WT mice. ***P <
0.001 by unpaired Student t test. Serum S100A8 levels (Right) in WT, Vhl
mutant, or Vhl/Vegf mutant mice. *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001, respectively,
determined by one-way ANOVA (n = 6 per group). (C) Serum S100A8 mea-
sured in WT, Vhl mutant, or Vhl/Hif-1α mutant mice. *P < 0.05 (n = 5 per
group). (D) Immunostaining of matrigel implanted in WT that had been
admixed with VEGF alone, S100A8 alone, or VEGF in combination with
S100A8. ***P < 0.001 determined by one-way ANOVA (n = 5 per group). (Scale
bars: 100 μm in A and D.) Data in A–D are the mean ± SEM.
