Fig. 1. Enhanced angiogenic phenotypes in mice deficient for pVHL in
hS100A8 myeloid cells. (A) Vhl mutant mice exhibited erythema (black
arrowheads) compared with WT mice. (B) Red blood cell (RBC) or hemo-
globin (HGB) levels in WT (n = 4) or Vhl mutant (n = 10) mice. Data are the
mean ± SEM. (C) Antibody array analyses of the Vhl mutant or WT mice
using bone marrow lysates. Note that Vegf levels (red arrowhead) were in-
creased approximately twofold in Vhl mutant mice. Quantitative results are
shown in Table S1. (D) Immunostaining of matrigel implanted in WT or Vhl
mutant mice for CD31 endothelial cells (red). Hoechst 33342 (blue) was i.v.
administered immediately before the matrigel harvest. (Scale bar: 100 μm.)
Quantification of CD31 area density is shown in the bar graph. Data are the
mean ± SEM (n = 7 for WT; n= 18 for Vhl mutant mice). *P < 0.05 determined
by unpaired Student t test. (E) Western blot of matrigel lysates obtained
from Vhl mutant or WT mice. (F) Immunostaining of matrigel in D for CD11b
(red) or CD31 (green). (Scale bar and n numbers are as in D.)
