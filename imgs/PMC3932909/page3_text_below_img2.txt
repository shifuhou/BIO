Fig. 2. Angiogenic phenotypes in mice deficient for pVHL in hS100A8 my-
eloid cells require HIF-1 activation. (A) Inactivation of Hif-1α in Vhl mutant
mice (Vhl/Hif-1α mutant) suppressed erythema of Vhl single mutant mice
(black arrowheads). (B) Antibody array analyses as in Fig. 1 for Vhl or the Vhl/
Hif-1α mutant mice bone marrow lysates. Note that the increased Vegf in
Vhl mutant mice is significantly reduced in Vhl/Hif-1α mutant mice (red
arrowheads). (C) Serum VEGF measured by ELISA (n = 5 per group). (D)
Immunostaining (Upper) and Western blots (Lower) of matrigel implanted
in Vhl mutant mice, Vhl mutant mice treated with NSC 134754, a HIF-1
inhibitor, or in Vhl/Hif-1α mutant mice. (Scale bar: 100 μm.) Quantification of
CD31 area density is shown in the bar graph (n = 10 for Vhl mutant; n = 7 for
Vhl mutant + NSC; n = 6 for Vhl/Hif-1α mutant). (E) Immunostaining of
matrigel implanted in WT, Hif-1α mutant, Hif-2α mutant, or Hif-1α /Hif-2α
mutant mice. Quantification of CD31 area densities in matrigel is shown in
the bar graph (n = 7 for Vhl littermate; n = 7 for Vhl mutant; n = 6 for Hif-1α
littermate; n = 10 for Hif-1α mutant; n = 4 for Hif-2α littermate; n = 6 for Hif-
2α mutant; n = 5 for Hif-1α/Hif-2α littermate; n = 6 for Hif-1α/Hif-2α mutant).
In C, D, and E, data are the mean ± SEM and *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and
***P < 0.001 determined by one-way ANOVA.
