Figure 2. HK2 Overexpression in Melanoma Cells Suppresses CD4+ T Cell-Mediated Anti-
tumor Responses
(A and B) Control (Ctrl) or HK2-OE Braf/Pten tumors were engrafted into the right and left 
flanks of C57BL/6 mice. Fourteen days later, the CD4+ TILs were isolated, stimulated in 
vitro by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs for 5 hr and analyzed for CD40L and IFNγ expression 
by flow cytometry. Left: percentage of CD40L+ (A) or IFNγ+ (B); right: mean fluorescence 
intensity (MFI) of the indicated proteins. (C–E) Ctrl or HK2-OE Braf/Pten tumors were en-
grafted into the right and left flanks of Rag1-KO mice mouse that were either injected with 
PBS or reconstituted with CD4+ T cells and 14 days later the weight (C and D) and size (E) 
of tumors was assessed. (C and D) Graphs show tumor weights of the contralateral pairs of 
ctrl and HK2-OE melanomas collected from same mouse expressed as actual weights (C) or 
as a ratio (D).
Data shown are cumulative of three (A and B) independent experiments (n = 3–4 mice/
group) or four (C and D) independent experiments (n = 2–4 mice/group). Data are expressed 
as mean ± SD and *p < 0.05 by unpaired Student's t test.
