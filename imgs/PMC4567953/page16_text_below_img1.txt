Figure 1. Tumor Microenvironment Deprives Glucose to Infiltrating CD4+ T Cells
(A) Bar graphs show the glucose concentration in blood and interstitial fluid of tumors and 
spleens from Braf/Pten melanoma-bearing mice.
(B and C) Glucose uptake in splenic and intratumoral CD44+/CD25lo and CD44+/CD25hi 
CD4+ T cells (B) or in TH1 cells cultured with or without Braf/Pten melanoma cells (C) was 
determined using fluorescent 2-NBDG and measured by flow cytometry.
(D) The expression of glucose-deprived signature genes in CD4+ T cells isolated from 
melanomas and draining lymph nodes (dLNs) was determined by qRT-PCR.
(E and F) TH1 CD4+ T cells derived from LCMV Armstrong-infected mice were stimulated 
by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs in vitro in the indicated glucose concentrations for 5 hr. The 
expression of IFNγ, IL-2, and CD40L was analyzed by flow cytometry (E), and production 
of TGFβ was determined by ELISA (F).
(G) The production of CD40L and IFNγ in CD4+ T cells isolated from the dLN, spleen, or 
tumors in Braf/Pten mice was analyzed by flow cytometry.
(H) LAP surface expression was compared between activated FoxP3+ (Treg) and FoxP3− 
(non-Treg) CD4+ T cells within melanomas using flow cytometry.
(I) Validation of LAP staining as a surrogate for TGFβ secreting capability was performed 
by stimulating purified intratumoral LAP+ and LAP− CD44+ CD4 T+ cells with or without 
anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs for 16 hr and measuring the amount of TGFβ in culture 
supernatants by ELISA.
