Host immunity provides wide spectrum protection that serves to eradicate cancerous cells in 
addition to infectious pathogens. Multiple types of immune cells are involved in tumor 
immunosurveillance and of particular importance are the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) (i.e., T cells) (Braumüller et al., 2013; Shiao et al., 2011). In most established tumors, 
however, the tumoricidal effector functions of TILs such as IFNγ production and 
cytotoxicity are restricted by multiple environmental factors. This includes the accumulation 
of immunoregulatory cells such as regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs), myeloid derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (Mellman et al., 
2011; Shiao et al., 2011). Additionally, alterations in the availability of nutrients (e.g., 
lactate and tryptophan-related metabolites such as kynurenine) in the tumor 
microenvironment can limit TIL activity (Yang et al., 2013). Another prominent feature of 
TILs is the increased expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors (e.g., programmed cell 
death protein 1 [PD-1], lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [Lag3], and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-
associated protein 4 [CTLA-4]) that desensitizes T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and 
contributes to their functional impairment (Baitsch et al., 2012). T cells displaying such
