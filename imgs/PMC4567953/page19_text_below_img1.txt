Figure 3. Glycolysis Modulates the Ca2+-NFAT1 Signaling Pathway in CD4+ T Cells
(A) Naive CD4+ T cells from Nur-77-eGFP mice were left unstimulated or stimulated with 
anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs for 5 hr in the indicated conditions and GFP fluorescence was 
measured by flow cytometry. Glc.: glucose; 2-DG: 2-deoxy-D-glucose.
(B and C) Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured in Fluo-4- and Fura-Red-labeled TH1 
CD4+ T cells cultured in 10 mM glucose or 0.1 mM glucose before and after activation with 
anti-CD3 crosslinking antibodies (B) or ionomycin (C). The ratio of Fluo-4 and Fura-Red 
fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry.
(D) Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured as above in naive CD4+ T cells isolated from 
wild-type (Wt) or GLUT-1-knockout (Glut1-KO) mice.
(E) TH1 CD4+ T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the indicated conditions 
and amounts of phospho-PLCÎ³1 were measured by flow cytometry.
(F) TH1 cells were stimulated with ionomycin in medium containing 10 mM or 0.1 mM 
glucose for 10 min and the cytoplasmic versus nuclear distribution of NFAT1 and NFAT2 
was determined by Amnis Imagestream. Representative histograms and images show the 
similarity profiles of NFAT1 (yellow, left) or NFAT2 (red, right) with DAPI staining to 
measure nuclear localization. The percentage of T cells with nuclear NFAT1 or NFAT2 is 
shown.
