Figure 5. PEP Suppresses SERCA-Mediated ER Calcium Reuptake
(A) Illustration of the glycolysis pathway and the targets of the indicated glycolytic 
inhibitors. 2-DG: 2-deoxyglucose; IAA: iodoacetate; OXA: oxalate.
(B) Heat map shows the normalized concentrations of the indicated glycolytic metabolites in 
CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs for 1 hr in the absence or presence 
of the glycolytic inhibitors described in (A) as measured by LC-QE-MS.
(C) Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured in Fluo-4- and Fura-Red-labeled TH1 cells 
treated with indicated glycolytic inhibitors before and after activation with ionomycin.
(D–F) TH1 cells were left alone or stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs for 5 hr in 10 
mM glucose in the absence or presence of indicated glycolytic inhibitors and the expression 
of CD40L (D), IFNγ (E) and TGFβ (Φ) was measured by flow cytometry (D) or ELISA (E 
and F).
(G and H) CD4+ T cells were transduced with empty vector control retroviruses (RV, Ctrl-
KD) or those expressing enolase-1 shRNAi (eno1-KD). RV-infected T cells were left alone 
or stimulated with ionomycin for 10 min and the cytoplasmic versus nuclear distribution of 
NFAT1 was determined by Amnis Imagestream as described in Figure 3F (G), or 
alternatively were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs in vitro in the presence of 10 
mM glucose for 5 hr and the expression of IFNγ, IL-2 and CD40L was analyzed by flow 
cytometry (H).
