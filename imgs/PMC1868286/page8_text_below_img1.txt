Figure 6. RT-PCR analysis showing the effect of hypoxia on the expression
of SNAIL and E-cadherin mRNA in OSE cells and in two ovarian cancer cell
lines. A: A specific band for SNAIL mRNA is detected in normoxia and is
increased under hypoxia in two cultured ovarian cancer cells, but not in OSE
cells. Along with SNAIL up-regulation, the expression of E-cadherin mRNA is
decreased in two ovarian cancer cells, but not in OSE cells. B: The density of
the bands for SNAIL was quantitated by densitometric analysis. C: The
density of the bands for E-cadherin was quantitated by densitometric anal-
ysis. Data are expressed after normalization with the G3PDH bands.
