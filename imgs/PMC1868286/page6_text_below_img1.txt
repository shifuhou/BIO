Figure 2. Immunohistochemical staining of HIF-1(cid:1) in ovarian carcinoma tissues. Nuclear localization of HIF-1(cid:1) is sporadically observed in the tumor cells in the
tip of the papillary projection (a) or in the vicinity of necrosis (b). Cytoplasmic localization of HIF-1(cid:1)is more frequently observed (c and d). a: Serous carcinoma.
b: Endometrioid carcinoma. c: Serous carcinoma. d: Clear cell carcinoma. Magnification, (cid:3)100
