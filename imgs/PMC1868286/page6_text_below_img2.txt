Figure 3. Topological correlation between HIF-1(cid:1) (a and c) and E-cadherin (b and d). In the serial sections for immunolocalization of HIF-1(cid:1) and E-cadherin,
the tumor cells with nuclear expression of HIF-1(cid:1)(a and c; arrows) are associated with reduced or loss of expression of E-cadherin (b and d; arrows), compared
with the surrounding tumor cells negative for HIF-1(cid:1). Magnification, (cid:3)100
