Figure 4. Northern blot analysis showing the effect of hypoxia on E-cadherin
mRNA in OSE cells and in two ovarian cancer cell lines. A: The specific bands
for E-cadherin mRNAs are decreased under hypoxia in SKOV3 and OVCAR3,
but not in OSE. B: The density of the bands was quantitated by densitometric
analysis. Data are presented after normalization with the G3PDH bands.
