Figure 7. Evidence for HIF-1(cid:1)-dependent and -independent regulation of VEGF expression, increase of EF-5 binding, and ectopic
angiogenesis in the mutant growth plate. (a,b) In situ hybridization analysis with VEGF cRNA on histological sections E15.5 from
wild-type and mutant tibias and fibulas; the darkfields for both wild-type and mutant specimens are shown (exposure to photoemul-
sion = 14 d). (c,d) In situ hybridization analysis with VEGF cRNA on histological sections from E15.5 mutant femur; brightfield and
darkfield are shown, respectively (exposure to photoemulsion = 24 d) . (e,f) Immunofluorescence detection of EF-5 in proximal epiph-
ysis of E18.5 wild-type and mutant tibia, respectively. (gâ€“j) H&E staining of histological sections of proximal epiphyses of mutant
newborn tibias; square and circles are drawn around areas of ectopic angiogenesis; h is a higher magnification image of g.
