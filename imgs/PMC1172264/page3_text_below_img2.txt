LN-homing attributes of tumor Ag-speciﬁc CD8(cid:1) TCM vs. TEM. (A and
Fig. 3.
B) Pmel TCM but not TEM roll efﬁciently on substrates coated with glycam-1, a
ligand for CD62L. Calcein-acetomethyl-labeled pmel TCM, TEM, or CD8-
enriched naı¨ve cells were injected at 1.5 dynes per cm2 into a parallel plate
ﬂow chamber in which the bottom plate was coated with glycam-1, E-selectin,
or BSA. After 4 min, rolling cells were photographed (four to six random ﬁelds
per condition) and counted in a blinded fashion (mean (cid:5) SD). (C and D) In vivo
LN homing of pmel TCM vs. TEM. CFSE-labeled, pmel-thy1.1 TCM and TEM were
adoptively transferred into separate Thy1.2 WT mice, and LNs were extracted
24 h later. (C) Cryostat sections of inguinal LNs 24 h after ACT of 4 (cid:4) 106
CFSE-labeled (green) pmel TCM (Lower) or TEM (Upper). High endothelial
venules were identiﬁed by staining for PNAd followed by Cy5-conjugated
secondary antibody (blue). (D) Cytoﬂuorometric analysis for CFSE(cid:1)CD8(cid:1) cells
from homogenized peripheral LNs and Peyer’s patches of recipient mice 24 h
after ACT.
