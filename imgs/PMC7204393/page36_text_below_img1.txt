Figure 6. Lipolysis Is Upregulated in Embryonic Diapause, in Diapause-like State, and in Rictor 
Knockout mESCs
(A) Abundance of TAG, DAG, FA, and AC in pre-implantation and diapause blastocyst.
(B) Schematic diagram depicting outline of the Lkb1 splice variant metabolomics 
experiment and abundance of TAG, DAG, FA, and AC in Lkb1 splice variants,R1(LL) and 
R1(SS), in control and starvation conditions.
(C) A simplified diagram of the mTOR signaling pathway, showing components, and 
downstream targets of mTORC1/2.
(D) Schematic diagram of CRISPR-Cas9 systemâ€“mediated homozygous Rictor (mTORC2 
specific component) KO in mESCs. Sequence and chromatogram(homozygote) of Rictor 
KO clone 14 mESCs.
(E) Screening of Rictor KO clones (top panel) by western blotting and analysis of Rictor 
knockout effect on mTOR and its downstream targets (bottom panel). (Beta-actin-1: pAkt 
and pmTOR, Beta-actin-2: pS6 Kinase and pS6, Beta-actin-3: Akt, S6 and 4EBP1, Beta-
actin-4: mTOR, Beta-actin-5: pULK1 and p4EBP1, Beta-actin-6: S6 Kinase).
(F) Schematic diagram depicting outline of the Rictor KO metabolomics experiment and 
Rictor KO effect on lipolysis. TAGs are downregulated in Rictor knockout clones compared 
to wildtype.
