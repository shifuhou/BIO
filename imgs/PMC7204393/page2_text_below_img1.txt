The term diapause describes a reversible, environmentally inducible state of suspended 
embryonic development that is associated with delayed blastocyst implantation. Diapause 
has been described in more than 130 mammalian species, indicating an exceptional degree 
of evolutionary conservation in the coordination between birth and favorable environmental 
conditions (Fenelon et al., 2014). However, the molecular controls of the entry and exit of 
this reversible dormant stage are poorly understood.
