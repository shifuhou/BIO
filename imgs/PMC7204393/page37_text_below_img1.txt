Figure 7. Inhibition of the Glutamine Transporters Leads to Exit from Diapause
(A) Glutamine transporters, SLC38A1, SLC38A2, and SLC1A5 are upregulated in diapause 
and starvation-induced diapause-like state.
(B) Schematic diagram depicting outline of the glutamine transporter inhibition in mouse 
diapause embryos.
(C) Immunostaining of diapause embryos with or without GPNA treatment (1h) for 
epigenetic, H4K16ac mark (magenta), and DAPI (blue). n = 4 diapaused embryos per 
treatment, p < 0.0001 for diapaused embryos versus diapaused embryo+10 mM GPNA. 
Scale: 20 μm.
(D) Hypothetical model of mouse embryos in diapause state. Pre-implantation embryos 
enter the diapause state through Lkb1-AMPK dependent down regulation of mTOR. 
Diapause is associated with upregulation of SLC38A1/2 and glycolysis, low mitochondrial 
activity, low fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO), increased NF-κB activity, and downregulation 
of mTOR. Downregulation of mTOR leads to upregulation of lipolysis, resulting in 
breakdown of TAGs. Glutamine transporters (SLC38A1/2) are required for epigenetic 
diapause state, plausibly through prolonged mTOR inhibition. PM, plasma membrane.
