Figure 2. Lkb1 Activation by Starvation Induces Diapause-like State
(A) Starvation moved mESC samples (R1/Lkb1) toward a diapause state. Cell line samples 
are projected in the PCA of in vivo samples using a previously described method (Kho et al., 
2004).* = Boroviak et al., 2015.
(B) Model of Lkb1 and starvation. AMPK is activated by starvation and is a target of Lkb1. 
Activated AMPK inhibits mTOR and induces diapause.
(C) Immunostaining of day 3.5 and diapause embryos with antibody against 
pAMPKa2(Thr172) (green) and OCT4 (blue). Scale: 20 μm.
(D) 1-h exposure to AICAR, starvation, or 2-DG (10 min) increased the activity of AMPK 
compared to untreated cells. beta-actin 1: pmTOR, pAMPKand pS6; betaactin 2: mTOR, 
AMPK and S6.
(E) Phosphorylation of mTOR, Akt(S473), S6, ULK1(S757), and acetylation of H4K16 in 
R1(LL) cells decreased after 24 h in starvation, whereas p4EBP1 did notchange. Beta-actin 
1, pmTOR and pS6; beta-actin 2, mTOR and S6; beta-actin 3, H4K16ac; beta-actin 4, 
pAkt(S473) and p4EBP1; beta-actin 5, Akt.
(F) Immunostaining of mouse ESCs with or without starvation. Staining was performed to 
detect pluripotent marker, OCT4 (green). The nuclei of all cells were stained blue with 
DAPI. Scale: 21 μm.
(G) Lkb1 siRNAs effectively knock down expression of Lkb1 at the protein level compared 
to the control luciferase siRNA. The efficiency of the transient siRNA approach was
