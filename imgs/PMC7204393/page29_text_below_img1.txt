Figure 1. Gene Expression and Splice Variants Separate Diapause Stage from ICM and Post-
implantation Stages
(A) Schematic diagram depicting outline of the experiment.
(B) PCA of our RNA-seq data showed that diapause is in a distinct transcriptional state 
compared to pre- and post-implantation epiblasts. (* = Boroviak et al., 2015)
(C) Scatter plot of gene contributions to PC1 and PC2 in the PCA plot in (B) showing genes 
that are specifically up- or down-regulated in diapause compared topre-/post-implantation.
(D) Metabolic pathway enrichment of genes differentially expressed between diapause and 
ICM.
(E) PCA plot using transcript splicing rate of our RNA-sequence samples clearly separates 
diapause and pre-/post-implantation samples.
(F) Sashimi plot of Lkb1 exons 8–10. Bar height represents expression level (FPKM). Arcs 
connect two exons that are spliced together.
(G) qPCR analysis of Lkb1 splice variant expression in ICM, dICM, and epiblast. n = 2 for 
each group, p = 0.001965 for ICM versus dICM, and p = 0.000102 for dICM versus Epi.
(H) Immunostaining of pre-implantation and diapause embryos with antibodies against both 
Lkb1 isoforms (red), OCT4 (magenta), or stained with DAPI (blue). Scale: 22 μm.
