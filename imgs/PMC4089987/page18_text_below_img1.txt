Figure 5. In vivo AIH increases neuronal differentiation in cultured NS progeny
NS from control or AIH-treated animals were plated without growth factors for 2-3 days and
assessed for expression of a neuronal marker via immunocytochemistry. Compared to
controls (A, scale bar = 50μm), fully formed NS from IH-treated animals (B, scale bar =
50μm) yielded larger with more distinct ß-III tubulin + neuroblast progeny (red: ß-III tubulin,
blue: DAPI). The inset in panel B is 60X image of boxed area, scale bar = 10μm. Panel C
shows a representative image of particularly large ß-III tubulin+ sphere-derived projections
obtained from cultures from an AIH-treated animal; scale bar = 100μm. The inset in C is a
40X image of the boxed area; scale bar = 50μm. ß-III tubulin positivity is quantified in panel
D as percent of cells that were ß-III tubulin positive (*: p<0.05).
