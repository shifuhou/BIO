Figure. 2. In vivo AIH increases in vitro NS and MASC expansion and proliferation
NS were serially passaged every 4-5 days and assessed for population expansion by
counting single, dissociated cells with a Trypan Blue exclusion assay. Compared to
normoxic (control) NS, those from AIH-treated animals exhibited progressive population
expansion (A, *: P<0.001 interaction between time and treatment). In addition, three days
after plating, more MASC could be detected in cultures from AIH-treated animals compared
to controls (B*: P<0.001 interaction between time and treatment). In parallel wells, NS
progeny were assessed for expression of the proliferation marker, Ki67. Representative
images showing Ki67 (red) and DAPI immunostaining (blue) are shown in panels C (AIH-
treated) and D (control) (scale bar = 25Î¼m). Compared to control, cells from AIH-treated
animals exhibited a significantly greater number of Ki67 positive cells (E, *: P<0.005).
