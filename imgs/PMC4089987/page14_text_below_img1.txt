Figure. 1. In vivo AIH increases in vitro NFC survival and expansion of NFC progeny cells
Single-cell NFC from control or treated animals were plated at clonal density (10,000
cells/cm2) with each replicate representing an individual animal, and cultured into full NS.
Representative examples of NFC derived from the SVZ are provided for control (A) and
AIH-treated pups (B, scale bar = 100Î¼m). On average, AIH treated animals yielded a greater
number of NS (C), reflecting increased survival of NFC. Individual NS from AIH-treated
animals were also significantly larger than those from control animals (D), reflecting
increased expansion within individual NS.
