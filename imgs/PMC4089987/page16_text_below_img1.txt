Fig. 3. HIF-1α signaling downstream of AIH affects NPC proliferation and differentiation
Freshly dissociated tissue from normoxic or AIH-treated animals was flash frozen, protein
isolated, and subjected to Western blot analysis. HIF-1α protein was increased immediately
following AIH as shown in the representative protein bands in panel A. Bands are shown
from multiple animals with “C” indicating control tissue and “H” indicating AIH treated
tissue. Densitometry results are expressed as a ratio of HIF-1α to Cyclophilin A and are
depicted in panel B (*, p<0.05 vs. normoxia). Panel C shows the results of experiments in
which cultured NS from normoxic or AIH-treated animals were dissociated to single-cells
and plated for MTT assay with or without EPO or VEGF neutralizing antibodies. NS
cultures from normoxic animals (black bars) exhibited less MTT activity than those from
AIH-treated animals across all conditions (red bars). AIH-treated NS exhibit only a partial
reduction in MTT activity under the same antibody blockade conditions (black series). Panel
D depicts second passage NS plated under conditions for terminal differentiation (i.e. in the
absence of mitogens on poly-L-ornithine coated coverslips) in the presence or absence of
neutralizing antibodies for EPO or VEGF. Inclusion of EPO or VEGF neutralizing
antibodies reduced the presence of process-bearing cells radiating away from the NS
perimeter (indicative of differentiating progeny cells) in both control (normoxic) and AIH
cells (*, #, p<0.0001). This reduction was less severe in AIH cells ($$, p<0.005; $, p<0.05).
