Figure 3. Glycolysis and Energy Generation in Myeloid Cells Are Severely Affected by the Loss 
of HIF-1α
(A) Lactate concentrations in macrophage supernatant were quantified under either control 
conditions (open bars) or after the addition of LPS (closed bars). Values were normalized to 
total protein content.
(B) Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from WT, HIF-1α-, VEGF-, and VHL-LysM-
CRE mice and cultured under ambient conditions for 24 hr. Cell lysates were harvested and 
intracellular ATP concentrations measured by means of a luciferase-based 
chemiluminescent assay. Values were normalized to total protein content.
