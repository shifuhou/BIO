Figure 2. Functional Inactivation of Hypoxic Response-Related Genes Significantly Impairs 
Gene Expression Patterns of Macrophages
(A) Peritoneal macrophages were cultured under normoxic (open bars) or hypoxic (closed 
bars) conditions for 8 hr, and total RNA was isolated and VEGF mRNA expression 
determined by real-time PCR. Values were normalized to RT-PCR results for ribosomal 
RNA. Normoxic WT levels were arbitrarily set as one. VEGF RNA was not analyzed in 
VEGF mutants due to the expression of a nontranslatable transcript in these cells. (B) 
Peritoneal macrophages were cultured under normoxic (open bars) or hypoxic (closed bars) 
conditions for 24 hr, and conditioned supernatant was harvested and VEGF protein analyzed
