Figure 1. Efficiency of CRE Recombinase-Mediated Deletion in Myeloid Cells
Genomic DNA was isolated from peritoneal macrophages (A) and neutrophils (B) from 
HIF-1Î±-, VEGF-, and VHL-LysM-CRE mice and subjected to real-time PCR with primers 
spanning the targeted region as well as primers for an undeleted control gene for 
normalization. Efficiency of deletion was calculated by quantitative PCR. (C) Differential 
leukocyte counts were performed on samples harvested by retinal bleeding.
