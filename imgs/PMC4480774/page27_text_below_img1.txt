Figure 7. Passively Induced Arthritis Is Dependent on Functional HIF-1α in Myeloid Cells
Animals were injected twice with heterologous serum from KbxN-TCR transgenic mice and 
monitored over a period of 3 weeks. Macroscopic appearance of hindpaws from (A)WT and 
(B) HIF-1α null mice 21 days after the initiation of serum injection. Limbs were fixed in 4% 
PFA and paraffin embedded. Histological analysis of (C) WT and (D) HIF-1α null ankle 
joints 23 days after arthritis induction. H&E, magnification 100×. (E) Throughout the course 
of the experiment, mice were blind scored every second day for clinical signs of arthritis as
