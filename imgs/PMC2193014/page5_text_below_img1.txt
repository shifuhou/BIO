Figure  3. Comparative  analysis  of  CD34  and  CD38  expression  of  highly  purified  CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:50)Lin(cid:50)  cells  after  4  d  of  culture  in  the  presence  of
BMPs. A representative experiment (n (cid:53) 3) of CD34 and CD38 cell surface expression performed on initially purified CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:50)Lin(cid:50) cells after 4 d
of culture in serum-free conditions or with the addition of factors as indicated. The entire contents of individual wells were collected at 4 d, stained with
mAbs, and analyzed using flow cytometric analysis.
