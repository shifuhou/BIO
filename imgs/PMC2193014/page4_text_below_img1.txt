Figure 2. Effect of ex vivo culture on the total cell number and num-
ber  of  clonogenic  progenitors  present  after  in  vitro  culture  of
CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:50)Lin(cid:50)  cells  in  the  presence  of  BMPs.  (A)  Purified
CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:50)Lin(cid:50) cells were counted and seeded (700–1,000) in wells
containing serum-free media or with the addition of factors indicated at
day 0. Cells were harvested from individual wells after 3 d of culture and
counted, and the mean fold increase in absolute cell number was calcu-
lated  (n  (cid:53)  4).  (B)  An  aliquot  of  100–300  CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:50)Lin(cid:50)  cells  was
plated in progenitor cell assays at the initiation of ex vivo cultures (day 0),
and the frequency of progenitors was calculated. Similar cell doses were
plated  from  wells  harvested  after  3  d  of  cultures  containing  the  various
factors indicated, and the mean fold increase in number of CFCs was cal-
culated compared with day 0 (n (cid:53) 3). Values are the mean (cid:54) SEM of de-
terminations  in  four  and  three  separate  culture  samples  for  cell  number
and clonogenic progenitors, respectively. *P (cid:44) 0.05, **P (cid:44) 0.01 indicate
statistically significant differences from controls.
