Figure  1. Expression of BMP receptors and SMADs in primitive he-
matopoietic tissue derived from human sources. RT-PCR reactions were
performed on human CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:50)Lin(cid:50) cells from CB (n (cid:53) 4), BM (n (cid:53)
2), M-PB (n (cid:53) 2), and stromal cells (n (cid:53) 2) as indicated for (A) BMP re-
ceptors ALK-3 and -6, and (B) human SMAD-1, -4, and -5. RT-PCR
was performed on whole human fetus sample as a positive control for the
reaction.
