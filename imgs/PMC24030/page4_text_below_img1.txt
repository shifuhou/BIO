FIG. 4. E1A inhibits hypoxia-driven transcription (31). (A) Hep3B
cells were cotransfected with 1 (cid:109)g of pCMV-lacZ and 0.5 (cid:109)g of
Epo49-Luc (32) (diagramed below the bar graph) and brought to 16
(cid:109)g of total with Bluescript DNA (Stratagene). Twenty-four hours
later, cells were infected with adenovirus type 5 bearing the indicated
E1A deletion mutations. The 1101 mutant deletes E1A residues 4–25,
while the 1107 mutant deletes residues 111–123. E1A(cid:68)111-123 inter-
acts with p300(cid:121)CBP but not with pRB (33), while E1A(cid:68)4-25 does not
recognize p300(cid:121)CBP but does bind to pocket proteins (33). The
adenoviruses also bore a mutation (dl520) rendering them unable to
synthesize 13S E1A (34). (B) Hep3B cells were infected with either
wild-type (wt) or with mutant adenoviruses as in A. After infection,
cells were placed in either 1% or 21% O2 for 6 hr; total cellular RNA
was extracted, and Northern blots analyses using a VEGF probe were
performed.
