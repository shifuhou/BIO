FIG. 3. Cotransfected p300 enhances hypoxic induction of tran-
scription from the Epo enhancer (30). Transient transfection of Hep3B
cells was performed with 1 (cid:109)g of a luciferase reporter gene (E)
containing the Epo enhancer upstream of the simian virus 40 promoter
or one in which the HIF-1 binding site has been mutated (Em). Cells
were cotransfected with 0â€“2 (cid:109)g (Left) and 0 or 2 (cid:109)g (Right) of
pCMV-p300 (4) with 1 (cid:109)g of pCMV-lacZ (to correct for variations in
transfection efficiency). The y axis shows the ratio of luciferase
expression at 1% O2 to that at 21% O2. Results on the Left are the
mean of triplicate experiments (cid:54) 1 SD and on the Right are duplicate
experimental points.
