FIG. 3. Identification of a DNA-binding activity induced by hy-
poxia. (A) Nucleotide sequence of wild-type (W18) and mutant (M18)
double-stranded oligonucleotides. Nt 1 to 18 from the hypoxia-
inducible enhancer are shown in uppercase letters, with the 3-nt site
of mutation in M18 overlined and underlined. (B) An induced nuclear
factor binds to wild-type, but not mutant, nucleotide 1 to 18 probe.
Nuclear extracts from Hep3B cells, cultured for 4 h in 1% (+) versus
20% (-) 02, were incubated with W18 probe, M18 probe, or a probe
containing a USF binding site (USF) and analyzed by EMSA. Binding
activities are labelled as follows: N, nonspecific; C, constitutive; I,
induced; U, USF; F, free probe. (C) Competition experiments
demonstrate specificity of binding. W18 probe (lanes 1 to 8) was
incubated with nuclear extract from Hep3B cells cultured for 4 h in
1% 02 (lanes 2 to 8) in the presence of no competitor (0) or 20-, 100-,
or 500-fold molar excess of unlabelled W18 (lanes 3 to 5) and M18
(lanes 6 to 8) competitor oligonucleotides and analyzed by EMSA.
