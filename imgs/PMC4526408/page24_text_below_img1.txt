(A and B) NADH/NAD+ ratio determined by enzymatic cycling assay in LF treated with 
siRNA targeting D2HGDH or L2HGDH expression (A) or overexpressing D2HGDH or 
L2HGDH (B). (C) F420/F485 fluorescence ratio, corresponding to cytoplasmic NADH/
NAD+, in LF treated with permeable analogues of 2OG, D2HG, and L2HG (500 μM) at 
time 0 normalized to the fluorescence ratio of untreated cells. Data are mean ± SEM. See 
also Figure S6.
