Hypoxia is an important environmental stimulus that causes genetic and metabolic 
reprogramming in cells to facilitate survival. This programmed response is mediated 
primarily through stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), a transcription 
factor that coordinates a shift in energy metabolism away from oxidative phosphorylation 
and toward glycolysis and lactate fermentation through the increased expression of glucose 
transporters (GLUT1), glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), and pyruvate 
dehydrogenase kinase (Semenza, 2012). These changes limit carbon entry into the 
tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and mitigate damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
generated by dysfunctional (uncoupled) electron transport in the mitochondria (Zhang et al., 
2008).
