Figure 1. Analysis of Dll4/Notch1 and HIF-1a-VEGF signaling molecules using Real-time RT-PCR. A. VEGF expression was significantly
down-regulated in missed abortion compared with induced abortion. B, C, D. VEGFR1, Notch1 and HIF-1a expression were significantly up-regulated
in missed abortion compared with induced abortion. E, F. VEGFR2 and Dll4 expressions were higher in missed abortion than in induced abortion,
whereas no statistical difference was observed.
