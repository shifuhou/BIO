Figure 3. Hypoxia-Induced L-2HG Arises via Promiscuous Substrate Usage by LDHA
(A, B, C) SF188 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting (A) IDH1 (IDH1-a, -b) and/or 
IDH2 (IDH2-a, -b), (B) MDH1 (MDH1-a, -b) and/or MDH2 (MDH2-a, -b), or (C) LDHA 
(LDHA-a, -b, -c, -d). 48 hr after transfection, cells were transferred to 21% or 0.5% O2 for 
an additional 24 to 48 hr, followed by measurement of intracellular 2HG. Western blot 
confirms target knockdown efficiency and shows hypoxia-induced expression of HIF1α. 
Expression of either S6 protein or α-tubulin are shown as loading controls.
(D) SF-XL cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting LDHA (LDHA-b) or both LDHA 
and MDH2 (LDHA-b/MDH2-b). 48 hr after transfection, cells were transferred to 0.5% O2 
and cultured for an additional 48hr in the presence of vehicle (DMSO) or the indicated 
concentrations of dimethyl-α-KG (DMαKG), followed by measurement of intracellular 
2HG. Western blot confirms target knockdown efficiency with α-tubulin shown as loading 
control.
(E). Schematic summarizing enzymatic sources of hypoxia-induced L-2HG. For each panel, 
representative data from 1 of 3 independent experiments are shown. See also Figures S2 and 
S3.
