Fig. 3. Abnormal yolk sac and placental vasculature in Dll4Lz/(cid:2) nvHet em-
bryos compared with WT embryos. (A and B) Whole-mount views of freshly
dissected embryos with intact yolk sacs showing lack of conducting arteries
(red arrowheads in A) and orange peel-like appearance of yolk sacs in nvHet
embryos. (C and D) Whole-mount ﬂat views of PECAM-1-stained yolk sacs
showing lack of conducting arteries (red arrowheads in C) as well as an almost
sheet-like and fused primitive vascular network in nvHet embryos. (E and F)
Hemotoxylin(cid:1)eosin-stained parafﬁn cross sections of yolk sacs showing gross
enlargement of the space between endoderm and mesoderm layers in nvHet
embryos (black arrowheads), in part due to an almost complete lack of
attachment sites (black arrows) between these layers, resulting in huge lacu-
nae-like vessels in nvHet embryos as opposed to the normally sized and
organized vessel cross sections seen in WT embryos. (G and H) High-power
views of the periphery of the whole-mounted PECAM-1-stained yolk sacs from
C and D. (I and J) Degenerative arterial changes in placentas derived from
nonviable Dll4Lz/(cid:2) embryos (as compared with those derived from vHet Dll4Lz/(cid:2)
embryos. (I and J Insets) Low-power whole-mount views of (cid:1)-gal-stained
placentas showing dramatic Dll4-reporter expression in umbilical arteries and
their branches extending out to placental periphery, with corresponding
high-power views highlighting apparent degenerative arterial changes in
center of nvHet placentas that leave only atretic vascular remnants (red
arrowheads).
