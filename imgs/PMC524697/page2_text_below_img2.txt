Fig. 1. Generation and preliminary analysis of Dll4 gene-targeted mice. (A)
Schematic representation of Dll4 gene targeting strategy achieved by using
VelociGene (19) technology. (Top) A 8.1-kb Dll4 genomic region spanning
exons encoding entire coding region (red boxes) along with ﬂanking homol-
ogy boxes (yellow boxes) used for bacterial homologous recombination ap-
proach to incorporate LacZ(cid:1)Neo reporter cassette shown (Middle), yielding
modiﬁed Dll4 genomic region (Bottom), in which the Dll4 coding region has
been precisely replaced by the LacZ(cid:1)Neo reporter. Location of short LONA
probes also depicted (red circles). (B) Representative screening data from
LONA screen (19) for correctly targeted ES cells; clones scoring positive in 16 of
16 independent LONA assays are indicated (yellow arrowheads). (C) Repre-
sentative genotyping data from F1 animals by using the LONA assay (19)
showing clear quantitative distinction between WT and Dll4Lz/(cid:2) Het mice. (D)
Quantitative RT-PCR results of levels of Dll4, Hes1, and Hey1 transcripts in E9.5
yolk sac RNA from WT and Het embryos. (E) Percentage of embryos and live
births that are WT versus Het for the modiﬁed Dll4Lz allele, with the heterozy-
gous offspring further subdivided between those that appear viable (blue
bars) versus nonviable (red bars) as discussed in the text; all offspring are
generated from breedings between male chimeras that are complete trans-
mitters of ES-derived sperm, to either C57BL(cid:1)6 females (Left and Center) or ICR
females (Right). Note that whereas (cid:1)50% of embryos (Left, yellow bar) are
heterozygous for the Dll4Lz allele, as would be expected, the vast majority of
these appear nonviable, deﬁning haploid insufﬁciency embryonic lethality.
