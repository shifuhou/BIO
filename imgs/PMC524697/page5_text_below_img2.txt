Fig. 4. Dll4 reporter gene expression reveals prominent expression in smaller
arteries and capillaries but not venous vessels in normal adult tissues, with
apparent induction during tumor angiogenesis. (A) Whole-mount views of
Dll4 reporter expression in aorta and its intercostal artery branches (red
arrowheads) of a viable Dll4Lz/(cid:2) adult animal. (B) Side-by-side views (from
retinal whole mounts) of a small artery (red arrowheads) next to a small vein
(blue arrowheads). (C) Prominent Dll4 reporter gene expression in most tissues
(urinary bladder wall is shown) seems to extend from small arteries into their
downstream microvascular networks. (D) Dll4 expression in an individual
vascular circuit (visualized within wholemounts of the adult retina): small
arteries, red arrowheads; capillaries, black arrowheads; and post capillary
venules, blue arrowheads. (E) Lower-power views of s.c. tumor sections
stained with anti-PECAM-1, demonstrating robust staining in all large and
small vessels, both in tumor and overlying skin (arrowheads). (F) In contrast,
Dll4 reporter analysis reveals stronger expression in tumor vessels as compared
with the vessels in the adjacent skin. (G and H) High-power views of boxed
areas in E and F highlighting small tumor vessels (black arrowheads) versus
large tumor veins (blue arrowheads).
