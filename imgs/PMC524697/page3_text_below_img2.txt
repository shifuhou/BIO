Characterization of Dll4 reporter expression patterns and vascular
defects in Dll4Lz/(cid:2) embryos. (A and B) Freshly dissected E10.5 embryos repre-
sentative of normal WT and nonviable Dll4Lz/(cid:2) heterozygous embryos (nvHet),
with black arrowheads in B, indicating dramatic pericardial edema; H, heart.
(C and D) Whole-mount (cid:1)-gal staining reï¬‚ecting Dll4 reporter gene expression
at E10.5 in a viable Dll4Lz/(cid:2) heterozygous embryo (vHet) compared with an
nvHet. In C, prominent reporter expression is notable in all of the major
arterial structures [i.e., internal carotid artery (ICA), dorsal aorta (DA), aortic
arch (AA), umbilical artery (UA), and intersomitic branches, unlabeled] as well
as in the neural tube (NT), and the level of cross section depicted in E is also
indicated, whereas in D arterial branches are less prominent or missing, and
red arrowheads indicate the location of the dorsal aorta in nonconstricted
region (F arrowhead) as well as constricted(cid:1)atretic region (G arrowhead). (E)
(cid:1)-gal-stained cross section at the level depicted in C from a vHet embryo,
showing that the Dll4 reporter is expressed exclusively in arterial endothelium
(red arrowheads, indicating paired dorsal aortas) and neural tube but not in
venous endothelium. (F) PECAM-1-stained cross section at the level depicted
by the F arrowhead, in D, revealing relatively normal paired dorsal aortas (red
arrowheads) and cardinal veins (blue arrowheads); perineural vessels around
