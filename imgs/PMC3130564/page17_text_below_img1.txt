Figure 3. PKM2 Promotes HIF-1 Transactivation
(A, B, G and I) HeLa cells were transfected with p2.1, pSV-Renilla, and empty vector (EV)
or the indicated expression vector, and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. The ratio of
FLuc:RLuc activity was normalized to EV (A, G and I) or shSC (B) at 20% O2 (mean ±
SEM, n = 4). *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs EV or shSC.
(C) Immunoblot assays of HIF-1α, HIF-1β, PKM2-V5, and actin in HeLa cells transfected
with EV or PKM2-V5 (M2) expression vector and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 4 h.
(D) HeLa cells were transduced with a retrovirus encoding shSC or two retroviruses
encoding different shRNAs targeting PKM2 (shM2), exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 4 h, and
WCLs were subjected to immunoblot assays.
