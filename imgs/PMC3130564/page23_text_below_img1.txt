Figure 6. PKM2 Enhances HIF-1 Binding and p300 Recruitment to HREs
(A) HeLa cells were transfected with shSC or shPKM2-#1 vector and exposed to 20% or 1%
O2 for 4 h. ChIP assays were performed with IgG, anti-HIF-1α, or anti-HIF-2α antibody
(mean ± SEM, n = 4). #p<0.05 vs shSC-20% O2; *p<0.05 vs shSC-1% O2.
(B) HeLa cells were transfected with shSC or shPKM2-#1 vector, and exposed to 1% O2 for
4 h. ChIP assays were performed with IgG or anti-HIF-1β antibody (mean ± SEM, n =
3). #p<0.05 vs IgG; *p<0.05 vs shSC.
(C and D) HeLa cells were exposed to 1% O2 for 24 h. ChIP assays were performed with
IgG, anti-PKM2 (C), or anti-PHD3 (D) antibody (mean ± SEM, n =
3). **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs IgG.
(E) Co-IP was performed in HeLa cells transfected with PKM2-V5 vector for 24 h.
