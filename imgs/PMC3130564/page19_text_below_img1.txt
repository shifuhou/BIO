Figure 4. Prolyl Hydroxylation of PKM2 Stimulates HIF-1 Transactivation
(A) GST-E10 was incubated with WCLs to induce hydroxylation and tryptic peptides were
analyzed by mass spectrometry. The fragmentation spectrum
of 401LAPITSDPTEATAVGAVEASFK422 revealed the presence of peptides with
hydroxylation of Pro-403 or Pro-408.
(B) HEK293 cells were transfected with WT FLAG-HIF-1α or double mutant (DM) FLAG-
HIF-1α(P402A/P564A) and treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μM) for 4 h.
IP was performed with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by immunoblot assay. The intensity
of hydroxylated FLAG-HIF-1α was quantified by densitometry and normalized to WT.
