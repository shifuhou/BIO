Figure 1. HIF-1 Regulates Hypoxia-Induced Expression of PKM1 and PKM2
(A) qRT-PCR analysis of Pkm1, Pkm2 and Slc2a1 mRNA in wild-type (WT) and HIF-1α
knockout (KO) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h (mean
± SEM, n = 3–5). ***p<0.001 vs 20% O2. ###p<0.001 vs WT MEFs.
(B) Immunoblot assays of HIF-1α, PKM2, histone H3, and α-tubulin protein in nuclear and
cytosolic lysates prepared from HeLa cells exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. The intensity
of PKM2 was quantified by densitometry and normalized to 20% O2 (mean ± SEM, n = 3–
4). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 vs 20% O2.
