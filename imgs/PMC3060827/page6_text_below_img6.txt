Figure 3. Characterization of the developmental potential of hESC-derived hematopoietic progenitors. FACS analysis and
corresponding cytospins of mature cells generated in culture from hESC-derived progenitors induced with defined factors. Images were taken at
406magnification. Cytospins of erythroid cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils were stained with Wright. Cytospins of megakaryocytes
were stained for GPIIb/IIIa (CD41a). Cytospins of mast cells were stained for tryptase. The yield hESC:mature cell indicates the number of each mature
cell type generated per each hESC induced to differentiate.
