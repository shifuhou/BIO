dissociated with TrypLe and analyzed by flow cytometry. To extend
the hematopoietic differentiation, after one week the cytokine
cocktail
in the differentiation medium changed to a medium
containing heparin (5 U/ml, Sigma), TPO (25 ng/ml), human
recombinant SCF (25 ng/ml), FLT3L (25ng/ml), IL-3 (10ng/ml),
IL-6 (10ng/ml), all from Invitrogen. At day 10 or 14 the floating
cells were harvested and analyzed using flow cytometry and colony
forming assays using methylcellulose-based serum-free medium
(MethoCult H4436, Stem Cell Technologies) and collagen-based
megakaryocyte colony assay (MegaCult, Stem Cell Technologies)
