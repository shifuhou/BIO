FIG. 7. Binding of in vitro-translated HIF-1 to the VEGF probe. HIF-1(cid:97) and
HIF-1(cid:98) were translated individually (lanes 1 and 2) or cotranslated (lanes 3 to
10) in reticulocyte lysates and incubated with the WT VEGF probe in the
absence (lanes 1 to 3) or presence of the indicated unlabeled oligonucleotide
competitor (COMP; lanes 4 to 6) or antiserum (AB; lanes 7 to 10). NS, nonspe-
ciÔ¨Åc DNA-binding activity present in reticulocyte lysates.
