FIG. 1. Functional analysis of human VEGF 5(cid:57)-ï¬‚anking sequences in tran-
sient expression assays. (A) VEGF-luc reporter constructs. Each deletion con-
struct is designated by the restriction enzyme used to generate the 5(cid:57) end, the
coordinate of which is indicated relative to the transcription initiation site (bent
arrow). The 3(cid:57) end of each construct ((cid:49)379) was fused to luc coding sequences.
(B) Expression in Hep3B cells. VEGF-luc and pSV(cid:98)gal plasmids were cotrans-
fected into Hep3B cells, which were split on to two plates that were incubated at
20% O2 (open boxes) or 1% O2 (closed boxes) for 48 h. Relative luc activity
represents the mean luc/(cid:98)-Gal ratio from four to nine independent transfection
experiments. The SEM was (cid:35)15% for all values shown.
