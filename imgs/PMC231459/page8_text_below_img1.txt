FIG. 10. Conservation of the hypoxia response element in mammalian VEGF
genes. The nucleotide sequence (56) of the 47-bp human VEGF hypoxia re-
sponse element is compared with the corresponding sequences in the mouse
(50a) and rat (28) genes. Crosses mark sequence identity. The HIF-1 site and
(A/C)ACAG sequences are overlined.
