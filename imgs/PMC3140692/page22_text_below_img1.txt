Hypoxia regulates other critical pathways that impact tumor progression in a HIF-
independent fashion. A schematic diagram of signaling pathways which regulate mRNA
translation is shown. These include the mTOR pathway and the integrated stress response.
Hypoxia influences AMPK and REDD1 activity, which act upstream to inhibit mTOR
kinase activity, resulting in a decrease in cap-dependent translation. Hypoxia also inhibits
the ER resident kinase PERK, which phosphorylates eIF2Î±, resulting in global protein
synthesis inhibition. While HIFs contribute to mTOR regulation via the induction of REDD1
during chronic hypoxia, all of these pathways can be regulated by O2 deprivation in a HIF-
independent manner. Although the mechanisms for mTOR and PERK regulation by changes
in O2 remain unclear, they represent important additional therapeutic targets.
