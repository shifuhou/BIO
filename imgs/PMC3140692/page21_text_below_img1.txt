Regulation of HIF-α subunits by O2 availability and other intracellular metabolites. In
oxygen replete cells, the HIF-prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) are active, resulting in the
hydroxylation of proline residues in HIF-α and their targeted degradation via the pVHL-
proteosome pathway. “Factor-inhibiting HIF” (FIH) hydroxylation of an asparagine residue
in the C-terminus of the HIF-α subunit, blocks p300 co-factor recruitment. This results in
the inactivation of HIF-α subunit transcriptional activity. All of these processes are inhibited
when O2 levels decrease or cells exhibit increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and other metabolites such as fumerate, succinate, and nitric oxide (NO). Here, the HIF-α
subunits are stabilized, they recruit co-activators such as p300, and activate HIF target
genes, as described in Figure 1.
