Figure 3. Coexpression of SA lineage markers. All panels are from cul-
tures grown in decreased oxygen plus 1 ng/ml BMP2 plus 5 mM forskolin.
Cultures were double-labeled with anti-TH (A, B) and anti-DBH ( C) or
anti-SA1 ( D). E and F show the merged images in A, C and B, D,
respectively. Thus, A, C, and E represent the same ﬁeld of one colony, and
B, D, and F represent the same ﬁeld of a second colony. C and D were
contrast-adjusted to subtract out background attributable to “bleed
through” of R-phycoerythrin secondary antibody (A, B) into the FITC
channel (C, D); this underestimates the number of DBH
cells.
Arrowheads in E and F indicate double-labeled cells. A–F, 403 objective
magniﬁcation.
