1992, 1994; Paulding and Czyzyk-Krzeska, 1999). Oxygen regula-
tion of DBH expression in vitro is less well studied, although
maternal hypoxia may lead to upregulation of fetal adrenal DBH
(Holgert et al., 1995). In all of these previous studies, however, the
levels of expression of these enzymes were only examined in
already differentiated catecholaminergic cells (Czyzyk-Krzeska et
al., 1992, 1994; Paulding and Czyzyk-Krzeska, 1999). Our results
suggest that commitment of multipotent stem cells to the SA
lineage may also be promoted by reduced oxygen in vitro, although
it remains possible that decreased oxygen additionally promoted
the survival of SA lineage cells.
