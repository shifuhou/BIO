hypoxic because they are below atmospheric oxygen levels; how-
ever, dissolved oxygen levels in culture under such conditions
remain high relative to oxygen concentrations in vivo, which aver-
age only 3% (Guyton and Hall, 1996). Because the solubility of
dissolved oxygen in interstitial ﬂuid and culture medium is the
same, a gas phase oxygen concentration of 3– 6% in culture should
give rise to oxygen concentrations in the culture medium that
approach average physiological levels. However, the precise rela-
tionship between the oxygen concentration we used in culture and
oxygen concentrations in vivo is difﬁcult to determine because
oxygen levels vary widely in vivo. Moreover, the kinetics of oxygen
diffusion and use may vary in important ways between the in vitro
cultures and in vivo tissues. Thus, it is difﬁcult to precisely compare
oxygen levels in vitro and in vivo, but oxygen concentrations of
3– 6% in culture are much closer to physiological levels than the
20% oxygen used in most tissue culture experiments.
