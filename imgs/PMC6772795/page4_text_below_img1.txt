Figure 1. Decreased oxygen promotes sympathoadrenal lineage differen-
tiation. Sciatic nerve p75
cells were cultured in decreased oxygen or in
20% oxygen, for a total of 12 d, either under standard conditions or with 5
mM forskolin and 1 ng/ml BMP2 added after 6 d of standard culture.
Cultures were ﬁxed and stained with antibodies against TH, DBH, and the
sympathoadrenal lineage marker SA-1. The bars show the percentage of
stem cell colonies that contained any cells expressing the given markers.
Error bars show SEs. Sympathetic markers were expressed at a signiﬁcantly
higher frequency in decreased oxygen and in the presence of forskolin and
BMP2 ( p , 0.05). In addition, in the presence of BMP2 plus forskolin,
there were considerably more TH
cells per colony than in the absence of
these factors (see Fig. 2 A, C).
