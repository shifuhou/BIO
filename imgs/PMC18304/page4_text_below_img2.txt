gene transcription. Hep3B cells were transfected with 5 mg of pSVbgal, 10 mg
of p2.1 (containing a hypoxia response element upstream of an SV40 promot-
er-luciferase reporter gene), and 125 ng of expression vectors encoding either
no protein (EV), full-length HIF-1a(FL), full-length HIF-1awith S551GyT552A
missense mutations (MIS), or HIF-1a(1–391y521– 826) (DEL). Transfected cells
were incubated under 20% O2 for 24 h. The luciferase:b-gal activity ratio was
determined and normalized to the value obtained from cells transfected with
empty vector (EV) to obtain the relative luciferase activity. Results shown
represent the mean and standard error for three plates of transfected cells.
