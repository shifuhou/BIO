pression. (A) Expression vectors encoding HIF-1a deletion constructs, consist-
ing of residues 1–391 fused to 429 – 826, 494 – 826, or 508 – 826, either wild type
(WT) or containing the S551GyT552A missense mutations (MUT), were trans-
fected into 293 cells and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 4 h. Nuclear extracts
were prepared, and 15-mg aliquots were subjected to immunoblot assay,
which detected both endogenous full-length (FL) and recombinant deleted
(D) HIF-1a. The expression of the deleted HIF-1a proteins was quantiﬁed by
densitometry. (B) Cells were cotransfected with pSVbgal and vectors encoding
HIF-1a(1–391y512– 826) (lanes 1–2), His6-HIF-1a(1–391y512– 826) (lanes 3– 4),
His6-HIF-1a(1–391y512– 826yS551GyT552A) (lanes 5– 6), or His6-HIF-1a(1–391y
512– 826yS551DyT552D) (lanes 7– 8). Transfected cells were exposed to 20% or
1% O2 for 4 h, and His-tagged proteins were puriﬁed from lysates by metal-
afﬁnity resin binding. Aliquots of puriﬁed protein (normalized to b-gal ex-
pression) were subjected to immunoblot assay by using an anti-HIF-1a poly-
clonal Ab, and protein expression was quantiﬁed by densitometry.
