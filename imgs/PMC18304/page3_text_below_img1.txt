regulation of HIF-1a expression. Expression of deletion constructs that were
wild type (WT) or contained S551GyT552A missense mutations is summarized
(Right). Regulation refers to the presence of increased protein expression
under hypoxic as compared with nonhypoxic conditions. Experimental results
are shown in Figs. 3 and 4.
