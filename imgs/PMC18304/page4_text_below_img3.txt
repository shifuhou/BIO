Expression of GAL4yHIF-1a constructs. COS cells were transfected

with pSVbgal and expression vectors encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain
(DBD) and either no additional residues (lanes 1–2) or HIF-1a amino acid
sequences 429 – 608 that were either wild type (lanes 3– 4) or contained the
S551GyT552A mutations (lanes 5– 6). Transfected cells were exposed to 20% or
1% O2 for 4 h. Lysates were prepared and 60-mg aliquots were fractionated by
SDSyPAGE and subjected to immunoblot assays by using an Ab against en-
dogenous HIF-1a (Top) or the GAL4 DBD (Middle). The isolated GAL4 DBD
(Middle, lanes 1–2) migrated faster than the GAL4yHIF-1afusion proteins and
thus is not within the portion of the immunoblot displayed. Expression of
GAL4yHIF-1a fusion proteins was quantiﬁed by densitometry (Bottom).
