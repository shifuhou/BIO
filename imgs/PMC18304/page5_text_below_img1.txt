Fig. 7. Analysis of HIF-1a ubiquitination. (A) 293 cells were cotransfected
with expression vectors encoding HIF-1a and either no protein (lanes 1–2) or
His6-ubiquitin (lanes 3– 4). Cells were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 4 h, and
lysates were prepared. Two hundred-microgram aliquots of total protein
were incubated with nickel resin and washed with buffer containing 75 mM
imidazole. Aliquots of unpuriﬁed (Top) and nickel resin-puriﬁed (Bottom)
lysates were subjected to SDSyPAGE and immunoblot assay by using an
anti-HIF-1apolyclonal Ab. (B) Levels of total and ubiquitinated HIF-1ain lanes
3– 4 were quantiﬁed by densitometry. The ratio of ubiquitinatedytotal HIF-1a
was determined and normalized to the result obtained for the lysates ana-
lyzed in lane 4 to yield the relative HIF-1a ubiquitination. (C) Cells were
cotransfected with: pSVbgal; expression vector encoding HIF-1a(1–391y512–
826) that was either wild type (WT; lanes 1–3) or contained the S551GyT552A
missense mutations (M; lane 4); and vector encoding either no protein (lanes
1–2) or His6-ubiquitin (lanes 3– 4). Cells were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 4 h,
and lysates were prepared. Aliquots of total protein (normalized to b-gal)
were incubated with nickel resin and washed with RIPA buffer (0.15 mM
NaCly0.05 mM TriszHCl, pH 7.2y1% Triton X-100y1% sodium deoxycholatey
0.1% SDS) containing 75 mM imidazole. Aliquots of unpuriﬁed (Top) or
resin-puriﬁed (Bottom) lysates were subjected to immunoblot assay by using
an anti-HIF-1a polyclonal Ab. (D) Levels of total and ubiquitinated wild-type
and mutant HIF-1a (1–391y512– 826) in lanes 3– 4 were quantiﬁed by densi-
tometry. The ratio of ubiquitinatedytotal HIF-1a was determined and nor-
malized to the result obtained for the lysate analyzed in lane 4 to yield the
relative HIF-1a ubiquitination.
