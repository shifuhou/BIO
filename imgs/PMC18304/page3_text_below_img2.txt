expression vectors encoding HIF-1a(1–391y512– 826) (lanes 1–2), HIF-1a(1–391y512– 826yC520 M) (lanes 3– 4), or HIF-1a(1–391y521– 826) (lanes 5– 6). (B) Analysis
of nuclear extracts from cells transfected with empty vector (EV; lanes 1–2) or HIF-1aconstructs consisting of residues 1– 826 (lanes 3– 4) or 1–391y512– 826 that
was either wild type (lanes 5– 6) or contained S515AyS517A (lanes 7– 8) or Y519F (lanes 9 –10) missense mutations. (C) Analysis of nuclear extracts from cells
transfected with HIF-1a constructs consisting of residues 1–391y521– 826 (lanes 1–2), 1–391y517– 826 (lanes 3– 4), or 1–391y512– 826 that was either wild type
(lanes 5– 6) or contained P513GyP516G (lanes 7– 8) or E512GyE518G (lanes 9 –10) missense mutations. (D) Summary of the data. The amino acid (AA) sequence
of HIF-1a residues 512–521 and the effect of missense mutations and deletions (2) on O2-regulated expression are shown.
