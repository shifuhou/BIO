fundamental vital cellular activities are impacted by HIF-2α  (EPAS1) in hypoxia, such as cell migration, survival, 
differentiation, apoptosis and metabolism11–14. The primitive cellular state is one of the significant advantages of 
MSCs; the more primitive the MSCs, the more properties of stem cells they retain, such as a high self-renewal 
potential. Proliferation is the fundamental activity of stem cells, and the proliferative potential impacts hPMSC 
transplantation in clinical regenerative and therapeutic applications. Therefore, we questioned whether HIF-2α  
also helps maintain the favorable stem cell properties of hPMSCs that remain in a hypoxic niche. If so, what is the 
mechanism involved in regulating HIF-2α  in hPMSCs?
