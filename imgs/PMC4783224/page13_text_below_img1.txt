Figure 1. The frequency of publications on the Warburg Effect from the 1920s-2010s
The Warburg Effect has been studied extensively since the 1920s with a surge in the number 
of publications from the 2000s to today. Many of the proposed functions of the Warburg 
Effect have also gained vastly renewed interest. Although energy (ATP), biosynthesis, and 
ROS have been intricately studied in the context of the Warburg Effect, acidification and 
acetylation have only recently gained attention.
