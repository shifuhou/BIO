HIF-α effects on p27 and Cyclin D2 levels require c-Myc. A. Western blot analysis showing
siRNA inhibition of HIF-1α (H1), HIF-2α (H2) and c-Myc (M) expression, as well as a
luciferase control (C) in HCT116 and WT8 cells. B. QRT-PCR analysis showing expression
of p27 in siRNA treated cells after 20 hrs. at 0.5% O2. Results measured by QRT-PCR from
4 experiments ate shown, error bars ±1 SEM. C. QRT-PCR analysis showing expression of
Cyclin D2 in siRNA treated cells. Results measured as above. D. Cell cycle progression
measured by BrdU incorporation in asynchronous HCT116 cells treated with control or
HIF-1α siRNA and WT8 cells treated with control or HIF-2α siRNA at 21% O2 (N) or
0.5% O2 (H) for 48 hrs. Results averaged from 3 experiments are shown, error bars ±1 SEM,
