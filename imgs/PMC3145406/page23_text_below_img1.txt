HIF-2α promotes focus formation by primary MEFs. A. Representative Wright-Giemsa
stained plates from MEFs transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 and pBABE vectors,
RasV12G, c-Myc, DPM-HIF-1α and DPM-HIF-2α. B. Colony counts from all transfection
combinations are shown. Results from 3 experiments, error bars ±1 SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p <
0.01. C. Colony formation in soft agar by cell lines derived from foci. 20× and 1OO×
magnifications are shown. D. Immunoblot analysis of HIF-2α, c-Myc and Ras
overexpression in representative clones obtained from foci picked from plates transfected c-
Myc, RasV12G, and pCDNA3.1, DPM-HIF-1α and DPM-HIF-2α. * indicates endogenous
protein. E. Model for HIF-α regulation of c-Myc activity. We propose that HIF-1α
specifically disrupts c-Myc/Max and c-Myc/Sp1 complexes, allowing more Mad/Max
interaction and DNA binding. On the other hand, we hypothesize that HIF-2α stabilizes c-
Myc/Max complexes, in turn promoting c-Myc DNA binding at both E boxes and Inrs.
