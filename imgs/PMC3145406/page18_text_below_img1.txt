Tumor cell lines expressing HIF-1α or HIF-2α exhibit differential hypoxic effects on cell
cycle regulators. A. Expression of c-Myc repressed targets p21 and p27 in HCT116 and
WT8 following 24, 48 or 72 hrs. at 0.5% O2. Results measured by QRT-PCR and averaged
from 4 experiments, error bars ±1 SEM. As described in the text, HIF-1α expressing
HCT116 cells and HIF-2α expressing WT8 cells exhibit opposite responses to hypoxia with
respect to c-Myc target expression. B. Expression of c-Myc activated targets Cyclin D2 and
E2F1 in HCT116 and WT8 as above. C. Western blot analysis of c-Myc target expression in
HCT116 and WT8 following 48 hrs. hypoxia. D. Expression of c-Myc targets in WT8 cells
overexpressing HIF-1α or HIF-2α following 24 hrs. at 0.5% O2. E. Change in p21 and p27
interaction with CDK2 assessed by CDK2 IP following 48 hrs. hypoxia in HCT116 and
WT8.
