Figure 4. Development of hypoxia and anoxia in tumour spheroids. Tissue sections taken from tumour spheroids grown over 17 days were stained for the pro-
liferation marker Ki-67 (green) and hypoxia (red). A distinct progression was observed: (a) day 4 of growth, with central hypoxia; (b) day 6 with beginnings of an
anoxic core; (c) day 15 of growth, with distinct core; (d ) day 17 of growth, distinct core and the degradation of spheroid integrity apparent.
