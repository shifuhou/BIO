Figure 3. Result of semi-automatic detection on the boundary between prolif-
erating and hypoxic regions on a day 17 spheroid. The dashed orange line
indicates the best estimate of the boundary r10, relative to the spheroid centroid.
When no line is present, the algorithm was unable to reliably detect the boundary.
