EF5 binding occurs maximally in the presence of hypoxia
at partial pressures below 10 mmHg [18]. Thus, we may
assume that the partial pressure at the interface between the
proliferating and hypoxic regions is approximately 10 mmHg.
The distance from the spheroid centre at which this transi-
tion occurs can be estimated from the images and compared
to the model prediction from equations (4.3) and (4.4) for
p Â¼ 10 mmHg, using the experimentally obtained value for con-
sumption rate a. These can be compared in order to investigate
and validate the model and estimate its predictive power.
