Figure 7 Effects of hypoxia and Hif-1a on the neuronal differentiation of MSCs. Each indicated group of MSCs were subjected to
neuronal differentiation by chemically deﬁned media under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Twenty-four hours after induction under
normoxic or hypoxic conditions, MSCs were examined by (a) morphology and the expression of each indicated neuron-speciﬁc genes was
determined by (b) western blot analysis. (c) Original current recordings in normoxic or hypoxic cells. Whole-cell current was elicited by a
50-ms depolarizing pulse to þ 40 mV from a holding potential of (cid:2)120 mV at 10-s intervals.
