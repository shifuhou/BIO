domain, PAS; Per/Arnt/Sim, ODD; oxygen-dependent degradation
domain, TAD; transactivation domain. The proline residues (P402,
p564) in ODD were substituted for Ala residues in the Hif-1a-PA
retroviral vectors WT or PA mutant

form of Hif-1a along with green ï¬‚uorescent protein (GFP).
(c) Comparisons for kinetics of Hif-1 a and Hif-1b (ARNT) protein
upon exposure to hypoxia (1% O2). Shown are representative
western blots for each indicated protein in MSCs during incubation
under hypoxic conditions.
