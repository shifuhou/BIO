Figure 3 (a) Effects of hypoxia and Hif-1a stabilization during expansion culture on the self-renewal of colony-forming mesenchymal
progenitor cells. (Upper) Illustration of the experimental scheme. Control (MSC/MPG) or Hif-1a-PA-transduced MSCs (MSC/PA) were
maintained under normoxic (21%) or hypoxic (1%) conditions for two passages (7 days), equal numbers of each group of MSCs were
then plated for colonization under normoxia. (Middle) Representative morphology of colony formation for each group of MSCs. (Lower)
Number of CFU-F formed from plating 1000 cells of each group of MSCs in the 100-mm dish. Shown are the mean±s.e.m. values from
four independent experiments. *Po0.05. (b) Effects of hypoxia and Hif-1a stabilization on the colonization process of MSCs. (Upper)
Illustration of the experimental scheme. Control (MSC/MPG) or Hif-1a-PA-transduced MSCs (MSC/PA) were maintained under normoxic
(21%) or hypoxic (1%) conditions for two passages (7 days), then equal number (1000/well) of each group of MSCs were plated under
normoxic (21%) or hypoxic (1%) conditions for colonization of mesenchymal progenitors. (Middle) Representative morphology of colony
formation for each group of MSCs. (Lower) Number of CFU-F formed from plating 1000 cells of each group of MSCs in a100-mm dish.
