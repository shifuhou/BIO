Figure 5 Effects of hypoxia and Hif-1a stabilization on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. (a, b) Control (MSC/MPG) or Hif-1a-PA-
transduced MSCs (MSC/PA) were subjected to osteogenic differentiation by chemically deﬁned medium under normoxic or hypoxic (1%)
conditions. At 14 days after differentiation, the cells were examined by Alizarin Red S staining and quantiﬁcation of mineralized nodules
as determined by absorbance at 550 nm after dye elution. Shown are representative morphology and mean±s.e.m. values from four
independent experiments. *Po0.05. (c) Expression of osteogenic gene expression during differentiation was analyzed by reverse
transcriptase-PCR. (d) Stabilization of TAZ during osteogenic differentiation of each group of MSCs were compared with each group of
MSCs during normoxia and hypoxia (1% O2). GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; OC, osteocalcin; OP, osteopontin.
