Figure 2 Effects of hypoxia and Hif-1a stabilization on the growth of MSCs in mass population. (a) BrdU incorporation analysis of MSCs
under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Cells were added with 10 mM of BrdU in the culture medium for 2 h. MSCs were then stained with
antibody against BrdU and propidium iodide (PI) for ﬂow cytometric analysis. Shown are the representative plots and percentage of cells
in each cell cycle fraction. (b) Effects of hypoxia on cell cycle inhibitory proteins in MSCs. MSCs were cultured under 21 or 1% O2 for
2 days and analyzed for protein levels of each indicated gene by using antibody speciﬁc to p21 or p27. (c) MSCs were maintained under
hypoxic (1% O2) or normoxic (21% O2) for at least two passages and plated in the dish (5 (cid:3) 104/100 mm dish density) at equal density.
Eight days after plating, the cell numbers were counted. Shown are the mean±s.e.m. values from three experiments. (d) Doubling times
were calculated as t/n, where t is the duration of culture and n is the number of population doublings calculated by using the formula
n ¼ log(NH (cid:2)NI)/log2 (where NI is the number of cells originally plated and NH the number of cells harvested at the time of counting).
Shown are the mean±s.e.m. values from three experiments. APC, allophycocyanin.
