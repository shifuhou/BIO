Figure 4 Effects of Hif-1a stabilization on the expression of
pluripotent genes in MSC. Control (MSC/MPG) or Hif-1a-PA-trans-
duced MSCs (MSC/PA) were exposed to 1% hypoxia and expression
of each indicated gene was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR.
GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
