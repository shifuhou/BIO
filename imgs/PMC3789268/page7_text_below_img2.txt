Figure 6 Effects of hypoxia and Hif-1a on the adipogenic differentiation of MSCs. Each group of MSCs were subjected to adipogenic
differentiation by chemically deﬁned media under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. (a, b) After 7 days in their induction media,
MSCs were stained with Oil-Red O and lipid accumulation was quantiﬁed by dye extraction and spectrophotometry at 502 nm.
Shown are the mean±s.e.m. values from four independent experiments. *Po0.05. (c) Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-g (PPARg) during adipogenic differentiation was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase.
