cipitate the receptor; however, a more harsh washing pro-
cedure was necessary to reduce nonspecific background
activity. The resin was washed once with lysis buffer sup-
plemented with 1% NP-40-0.5% sodium deoxycholate-0.1%
SDS, once with 1 M NaCl (pH 7.4), and intervening washes
with 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2)-10% glycerol-150
mM NaCl-1 mM EDTA-1% NP-40. The proteins were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above.
