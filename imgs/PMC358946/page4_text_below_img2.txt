FIG. 2. Time course of inhibition of the cytochrome P-450IA1
mRNA induction response by pretreatment or simultaneous treat-
ment with TPA. (A) RNA blot analysis of total RNA prepared from
cells treated either with the solvent DMSO alone or with 50 nM
TCDF in the absence or presence of simultaneously added 50 nM
TPA for the indicated times. In lanes marked TPA PRE, the cells
were incubated with 50 nM TPA for 24 h prior to the addition of
TCDF. (B) Densitometric determination of the P450IA1 mRNA
signals obtained in panel A, normalized to the GAPDH signal. The
TCDF-induced P450IA1 signal at each time point was set to 100%.
(C) Total cellular PKC activity measured in extracts prepared from
control cells and from cells treated with 50 nM TPA for 4 and 16 h.
The values represent averages for two independent experiments.
The activity at 0 h of TPA treatment was set to 100%.
