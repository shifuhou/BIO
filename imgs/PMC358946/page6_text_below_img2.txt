receptor was activated to a nuclear DNA-binding form by
exposure of the cells to TCDF for 1 h (26, 34). The in
vivo-activated receptor generated a complex with the XRE
probe that was not detected in nuclear extracts from control
cells (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2; the receptor-depen-
dent complex is indicated by an R). In contrast, the protein-
DNA complex generated by adenovirus major late transcrip-
tion factor USF (31 and references therein) was unaffected
by TCDF treatment and served as a control for the quality of
the extracts (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 1 and 2). The specificity
of the TCDF-induced XRE complex was characterized by
DNA competition experiments. Formation of the dioxin
receptor-dependent XRE complex could be abolished by the
addition of a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled XRE
sequence motif but not by the addition of an identical molar
excess of an unrelated sequence (Fig. SA, compare lanes 8
and 9). Moreover, the XRE complex generated by nuclear
extracts from TCDF-treated human keratinocytes comi-
grated with that generated by the in vitro-activated cytosolic
or in vivo-activated nuclear dioxin receptor from mouse
hepatoma cells (data not shown).
