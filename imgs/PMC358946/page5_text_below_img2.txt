FIG. 3. Inhibition of the cytochrome P-450IA1 mRNA induction
response by protein kinase inhibitors. Keratinocytes were treated
for the indicated times with 50 nM TCDF in the absence or presence
of the following protein kinase inhibitors: A, 100 ,uM H-7 (24 h); B
200 nM staurosporine (STAURO) (8 h). (C) Cells were pretreated
(see Materials and Methods for details) with 1 pM calphostin C
(CALPH) prior to the addition of TCDF and incubation for an
additional 6 h. Subsequently, the cells were analyzed for expression
of cytochrome P-450IA1 or GAPDH mRNA by RNA blot analysis.
