FIG. 7. Distinct effects of phosphatase treatment of the dioxin receptor and its coregulator Arnt. (A) Restoration of the XRE-binding form
of the dioxin receptor was achieved after coincubation of cytosol from mutant cells lacking a functional Arnt (nt- DR) and in vitro-expressed
Arnt (lanes 5 to 7). No specific DNA-binding activity was seen when either Arnt or the mutant cytosol was used (lane 3 or 4, respectively).
The restored DNA-protein complex was abolished after preincubation with the anti-dioxin receptor antiserum (atDR; lane 6) but was
unaffected by preimmune serum (PIS: lane 7). Lane 1 shows the mobility of the probe alone (Free). Lane 2 shows the binding activity of the
unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate (URL), whereas R indicates the position of the receptor complex. (B) Dephosphosphorylation (dp) of Arnt
(lane 2) or the dioxin receptor in the nt- DR cytosol (lane 3) inhibited the reconstitution of the XRE-binding activity. (C) Coimmunopecip-
itation of the dioxin receptor and 35S-labeled, in vitro-expressed Arnt was observed with the anti-dioxin receptor antiserum (lane 1) but not
with preimmune serum (lane 2). This coimmunoprecipitation of Arnt appeared insensitive to phosphatase treatment of the receptor (lane 5),
while phosphatase treatment of Arnt disrupted the complex (lane 6). (D) The results of panels A to C and Fig. 5F are summarized in a model
of the role of phosphorylation processes (P) in the regulation of dioxin receptor action. H, hsp90; A, Arnt; D, receptor.
