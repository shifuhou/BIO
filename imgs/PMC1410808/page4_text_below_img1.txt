Increased Oct-4, Vegf, and Tgf-(cid:1) expression in Hif-2(cid:1)

KI/KI embryos. (A) Genotypes of individual E7.5 embryos were
determined by PCR on genomic DNA and quantitative RT–PCR
analysis of Hif-1(cid:1), Hif-2(cid:1), and Pgk transcripts. Transcript levels
were normalized to 18S rRNA transcripts in each sample. Data
are expressed as the ratio of target gene expression in each
sample relative to a known wild-type (WT) litter (n = 8) that was
stage matched. (B) Average levels of Hif-1(cid:1) and Hif-2(cid:1) mRNA in
embryos pooled by genotype. (C) Average levels of Oct-4, Vegf,
and Tgf-(cid:1) mRNA in embryos pooled by genotype. (D–F) Whole-
mount RNA in situ hybridization for Oct-4 mRNA demon-
strated that Oct-4 is expressed in the embryonic epiblast in both
wild-type (WT) and homozygous Hif-2(cid:1) KI/KI E7.5 embryos.
