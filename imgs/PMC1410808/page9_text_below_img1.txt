Figure 7. HIF-2(cid:1) is required for Oct-4 expression and normal
PGC numbers. (A) Real-time PCR analysis demonstrates in-
creased hypoxic induction (1.5% O2 for 16 h) of Oct-4 mRNA in
wild-type (WT) and Hif-1(cid:1)−/− 3.5-d EBs, which is diminished in
Hif-2(cid:1)−/− EBs. (B–D) PGCs in E8.5 embryos revealed by AP
staining. Arrows point to representative PGCs in C and D. In
contrast to wild-type (WT) and heterozygous Hif-2(cid:1)+/− litter-
mate controls (C), somite-matched Hif-2(cid:1)−/− embryos exhibit
reduced numbers of PGCs (D). (B) Quantification of PGC num-
bers in somite-matched E8.5 (s7–s11) embryos. (E,F) PGCs in
E12.5 genital ridges dissected from embryos revealed by AP
staining. (G) Proposed model for regulation of Oct-4 by HIF-2(cid:1).
In PGCs, the Oct-4 locus is expressed and regulated by HIF-2(cid:1).
The Oct-4 locus is also expressed in ES cells; however, HIF-2(cid:1)
activity is normally restricted or repressed in these cells (C.-J.
Hu, S. Iyer, A. Sataur, K.L. Covello and M.C. Simon, in prep.). In
differentiating somatic cells, the Oct-4 locus adopts a closed
conformation and is not expressed. At this point, HIF-2(cid:1) regu-
lates other target genes (e.g., Vegf) without modulating Oct-4
levels. In homozygous Hif-2(cid:1) KI/KI embryos, EBs, and terato-
mas, expanded HIF-2(cid:1) expression results in up-regulation of
Oct-4 and other targets. HIF-2(cid:1)-mediated expression of an in-
appropriately derepressed Oct-4 locus in transformed cells
could similarly modulate cancer stem cell identity and tumor
progression.
