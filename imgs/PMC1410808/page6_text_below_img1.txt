tive HRE each in CR4 and CR3, one HRE between CR4
and CR3, and three HREs between CR2 and CR1 in the
human and mouse promoter (Fig. 4D). Chromatin immu-
noprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that HIF-2(cid:1)
occupied the HREs in CR4 and CR3, but not the HREs
between CR2 and CR1, in hypoxic human RCC cells
(786-O WT-8) that express stabilized HIF-2(cid:1), but not
HIF-1(cid:1) (data not shown; Maxwell et al. 1999). ChIP ex-
periments in 293 cells that express doxycycline-induc-
ible forms of HIF-1(cid:1) and HIF-2(cid:1) demonstrated that HIF-
2(cid:1), but not HIF-1(cid:1), occupies the HREs in the Oct-4 pro-

moter and enhancer
deletion of these HREs abrogates the hypoxic induction
of Oct-4 (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these data indicate
that endogenous HIF-2(cid:1) binds to HREs in Oct-4 regula-
tory regions in cells and is consistent with the hypoth-
esis that HIF-2(cid:1) directly activates Oct-4 expression in
our KI model.
