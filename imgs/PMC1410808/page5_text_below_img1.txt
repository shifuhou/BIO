Increased Vegf and Tgf-(cid:1) expression in Hif-2(cid:1) KI/KI
Figure 3.
3.5 d EBs. (A) Schematic of HIF-1(cid:1) control knock-in allele, in
which a c-Myc-tagged Hif-1(cid:1) cDNA was targeted to the first
coding exon of the murine Hif-1(cid:1) locus in ES cells. A detailed
description is presented in Supplementary Figure 2. (B) Extracts
from homozygous Hif-1(cid:1) KI/KI and Hif-2(cid:1) KI/KI ES cells were
immunoprecipitated with c-Myc epitope antibodies and then
analyzed on Western blots using c-Myc antibodies. Western blot
analysis using AKT antibodies confirms that each sample in the
immunoprecipitation experiment had equal amounts of input
protein. (N) Normoxia (21% O2); (H) hypoxia (4 h at 1.5% O2).
(C) Quantitative RT–PCR analysis in 3.5-d EBs of Alda A tran-
scripts in wild-type (WT) and homozygous Hif-1(cid:1) KI/KI, Hif-2(cid:1)
KI/KI, and Hif-1(cid:1)−/− EBs. Fold change indicates increases in
mRNA in EBs grown at 3.0% O2 relative to EBs grown at 21%
O2. Transcript levels were normalized to 18S rRNA transcripts
in each sample. (D) Real-time PCR analysis in 3.5-d EBs cul-
tured at 21% O2 indicates increased Tgf-(cid:1), Vegf, and Hif-2(cid:1)
mRNA in two independently derived homozygous Hif-2(cid:1) KI/KI
clones. Changes in expression are specific to the Hif-2(cid:1) KI al-
lele, as Hif-1(cid:1) KI/KI clones and Hif-1(cid:1)−/− EBs behave similarly
to wild type. (*) p < 0.005.
