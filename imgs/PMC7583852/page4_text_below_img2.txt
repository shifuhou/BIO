Figure 3. The viability and doubling time of the Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells
(WJ-MSCs) that were exposed to 2.0 PSI pressure with 5% hypoxic condition. (A) An ATP assay was
performed in order to observe the cell viability of the WJ-MSCs at passage 0, at 24-, 48-, and 72-h
post-initial cultivation under each condition. The data are presented as Mean ± S.E.M. (B) Doubling time
of WJ-MSCs was calculated according to passage 1 and passage 2 of each condition. C: control; C + H:
control + 5% O2 hypoxia; C+H+P: control + 5% O2 hypoxia + 2.0 PSI. * p-value < 0.05. Six batches per
groups were assigned and tested.
