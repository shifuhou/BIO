Figure 2. Confirmation of the yield of Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) under
different high-pressure conditions. (A) Observation of the shape of the cells through an optical microscope
on the 3rd, 5th, and 7th days of the initial culture of the WJ-MSCs. The WJ-MSCs were cultured under
control, 5% hypoxia with 2.0 PSI, or 5% hypoxia with 2.5 PSI pressure conditions. Scale bar = 100 µm.
(B) Calculation of the yield of the WJ-MSCs by 7 days post WJ-MSC seeding. C: 5% CO2, 37
C as a control;
C+H+P (2.0): control + 5% O2 hypoxia + 2.0 PSI; C+H+P (2.5): control + 5% O2 hypoxia + 2.5 PSI. The
data are presented as mean ± S.E.M. * p-value < 0.05. Six batches per groups were assigned and tested.
