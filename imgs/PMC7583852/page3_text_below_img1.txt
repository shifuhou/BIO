Figure 1. Confirmation of the yield of Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) under
high-pressure conditions. (A) Observation of star-shaped cells by optical microscopy on the 4th, 9th,
and 9th days of the initial culture of WJ-MSCs. The WJ-MSCs were cultured under control, 5% hypoxia,
or 5% hypoxia with 2.0 PSI pressure conditions. Scale bar = 100 µm. (B) Calculation of the yield of WJ-MSCs
C as a control, C+H: control + 5% O2 hypoxia, C+H+P:
by 9 days post-WJ-MSC seeding. C: 5% CO2, 37
control + 5% O2 hypoxia + 2.0 PSI, mean ± S.E.M. * p-value < 0.05. Six batches per groups were assigned
and tested.
