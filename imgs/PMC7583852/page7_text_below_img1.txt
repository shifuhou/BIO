Figure 6. Therapeutic eﬀects of WJ-MSCs on C2C12 cell death in an in vitro model. WJ-MSCs exposed
to high-pressure and/or hypoxia were co-cultured with C2C12 cells in an in vitro cell death model.
(A) After 24 h, microscopic images were taken of the C2C12 cells in each group, and their cell conﬂuency
was measured from these images. Scale bar: Scale bar = 100 µm. (B) The anti-apoptotic eﬀects of
WJ-MSCs on the C2C12 cells were conﬁrmed by Western blot using cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3
antibodies. The bands were normalized to beta actin. The band intensities were quantiﬁed using
Image J software. Control: C2C12 cells; C: co-cultured with control WJ-MSCs. C+H: co-cultured with
WJ-MSCs exposed to hypoxia; C+H+P: co-cultured with WJ-MSCs exposed to high pressure and
hypoxia. ** p-value < 0.01, *** p-value < 0.001. Six batches per groups were assigned and tested.
