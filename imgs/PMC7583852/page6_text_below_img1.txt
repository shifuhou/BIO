Figure 5. The 3
-mRNA sequencing analysis under high-pressure conditions. (A) Gene clustering analysis
was conducted for 49 genes related to cell proliferation. The upregulated genes are represented in red,
and the down-regulated genes are represented in blue. The name of each gene is shown to the right of
the clustering map, and the groups or genes with similar expression patterns as a result of clustering
were placed close together. (B) The genes upregulated upon exposure of the cells to high pressure and/or
hypoxia are shown in the Venn diagram. The number of genes with increased expression under hypoxia
only, under high pressure only, of under both conditions are shown inside of the circles, and the number
of genes with decreased expression under these conditions is marked on the outside. (C) The mRNA
expression change in the 49 selected genes, in relation to cell proliferation, is described as an expression plot.
Under the C, C+H, and C+H+P conditions, the amount of the expression of each gene was normalized
and converted to a log2 value. (D) DAGLA and CRLF3 are related to cell proliferation; GCP4 is related to
the cell cycle; and XDH is related to therapeutic efficacy; these genes were selected and presented on the
expression graph. C: control, C+H:+hypoxia, C+H+P: + hypoxia + pressure.
