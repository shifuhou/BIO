FIG. 1. Hypoxic (CoCl2) induction of HIF-1(cid:97)protein levels in HeLa
cells. (A) HeLa cells were either treated with vehicle only (lanes 1, 3, and
5) or induced with 100 (cid:109)M CoCl2 for 4 or 24 h, and whole cell extracts
were prepared. Twenty-microgram aliquots of the extracts were separated
on a 7.5% SDS(cid:121)polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose
filter. The transferred proteins were detected with rabbit anti-HIF-1(cid:97)
antiserum (1:400, lanes 1–4) or with rabbit anti-Arnt antibody (1:200
dilution, lanes 5 and 6) and visualized by chemiluminescence. Arrowheads
indicate the specific HIF-1(cid:97)and Arnt complexes. (B) Total cellular RNA
was prepared from duplicate samples corresponding to lanes 1 to 4 in A
and analyzed by RNA (Northern) blot for HIF-1(cid:97) mRNA levels. As a
control, the same blot was rehybridized with a (cid:98)-actin probe (lanes 5–8).
(C) Induction of HIF-1(cid:97) protein levels by hypoxia. HepG2 cells were
incubated under normoxic (20% oxygen, lane 1) or hypoxic (1% oxygen,
lane 2) for 4 h, and whole cell extracts were prepared. Immunoblot
analysis was performed as in A.
