FIG. 2. Arnt induces a conformational change in HIF-1(cid:97). (A) HIF-1(cid:97)
was in vitro translated in reticulocyte lysate and allowed to interact with
vaccinia virus-expressed, histidine-tagged, and purified Arnt (Arnt-H6)
or control (Cntr.) extracts (lanes 2–5) or with bacterially expressed,
purified GST, or GST–Arnt fusion protein (lanes 6 and 7) at room
temperature for 1 h. A total of 0.5 (cid:109)g (lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7) or 2 (cid:109)g (lanes
4 and 5) of S. aureus Glu-C protease was added, and the samples were
incubated for 30 min at 30(cid:56)C. Reaction products were run on a 12.5%
SDS(cid:121)polyacrylamide gel and visualized by fluorography. The Arnt-
induced protease-resistant product is indicated by an arrowhead. Lane 1
represents full-length HIF-1(cid:97) with no added protease. (B) Wheat germ
lysate-expressed HIF-1(cid:97) is not associated with hsp90. [35S]Methionine
labeled full length HIF-1(cid:97), synthesized either in reticulocyte (RL) or in
wheat germ lysate (WGL), was coimmunoprecipitated with either mono-
clonal anti-hsp90 (lanes S) IgM antibody or control (lanes C) IgM
antibody as described. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by
7.5% SDS(cid:121)PAGE and fluorography. Lanes 1 and 4 represent 10% of the
inputs of in vitro synthesized HIF-1(cid:97). (C) Wheat germ lysate-expressed
HIF-1(cid:97) does not undergo an allosteric change in the presence of Arnt.
Wheat germ lysate-translated HIF-1(cid:97)(lane 2) was treated with either 0.5
(cid:109)g (lanes 3 and 4), 1.5 (cid:109)g (lanes 5 and 6), or 4.0 (cid:109)g (lanes 7 and 8) Glu-C
protease for 30 min at 30(cid:56)C in the presence of GST (lanes 3, 5, and 7) or
full-length GST–Arnt (lanes 4, 6 and 8). The reaction products were
separated on a 12.5% SDS(cid:121)polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by fluorog-
raphy. Lane 1 represents HIF-1(cid:97) expressed in reticulocyte lysate.
