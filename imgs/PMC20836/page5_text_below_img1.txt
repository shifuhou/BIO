FIG. 4. Full-length HIF-1(cid:97) forms a DNA-binding complex with bacterially expressed Arnt. Six microliters of reticulocyte lysate-expressed
HIF-1(cid:97)was allowed to interact with either GST (lane 3), full-length Arnt (lanes 4–6, 9, and 10), Arnt1-407, or Arnt1-140 (lanes 7 and 8), respectively.
In lanes 5 and 6, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA was added (specific and nonspecific, respectively), whereas in lanes 9 and
10 control (C) or specific (S) anti-HIF-1(cid:97) antibodies were added to the reactions. The arrowhead indicates the HIF-1(cid:97)–Arnt complex, whereas
the asterisks denote nonspecific protein DNA complexes formed with unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate only (lane 2). Lane 1 represents free probe
in the absence of any added protein. (B) The dioxin receptor forms a DNA binding complex with either full-length Arnt or Arnt1-407. Hepa 1c1c7
C4 cell cytosol was treated with 5 nM dioxin for 2 h to activate the dioxin receptor. Forty micrograms of dioxin-treated cytosol was incubated with
GST (lane 3), full-length Arnt, Arnt1-407, or Arnt1-140 (lanes 4–6, respectively) at room temperature for 45 min. A 32P-labeled xenobiotic response
element (XRE)-containing oligonucleotide was added as a probe and incubation continued for additional 15 min before electrophoresis. Lane 1,
32P-labeled XRE alone; lane 2, 32P-labeled XRE in the presence of the cytosolic extract without any added recombinant protein. Dioxin
receptor–Arnt complexes are indicated by arrowheads.
