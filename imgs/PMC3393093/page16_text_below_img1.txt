Figure 4. Disruption of respiration increases ROS and DNA damage response in both primary
human fibroblasts and other cancer cells
(a) Human fibroblasts were stably transduced with nonspecific (NS) or SCO2 short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) and ROS levels were analysed by FACS (n = 3). Western blotting was
conducted to confirm SCO2 knockdown. β-Actin serves as loading control. (b) Effect of
SCO2 knockdown on γ-H2AX in primary fibroblasts and its sensitivity to ambient oxygen.
(c) The COX10 subunit was knocked down in HCT116 SCO2 +/+ cells by stable shRNA
transduction and was confirmed by western blotting versus nonspecific (NS) shRNA.
VDAC serves as loading control. Functional disruption of respiration was confirmed by
oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification ratios (respiration/glycolysis) using a
Seahorse Bioscience XF24 instrument (n = 5). (d) Effect of COX10 knockdown on γ-H2AX
in HCT116 SCO2 +/+ cells and its sensitivity to ambient oxygen. (e) DNA damage response
in non-respiring human osteosarcoma 143B ρo cells versus respiring 143B ρ+ cells and its
sensitivity to ambient oxygen. β-Actin serves as protein loading control. (f) Quantification
of the DNA damage response by densitometric scanning of γ-H2AX protein levels
normalized by β-actin in 143B cells (n = 3). Values shown as mean and s.e.m.; P-values are
determined by Student's t-test.
