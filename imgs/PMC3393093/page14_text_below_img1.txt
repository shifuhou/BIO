Figure 2. Disruption of respiration increases ROS levels in association with increased reducing
equivalents and intracellular oxygen
(a) Relative ROS levels in the respective cells types quantified by DCF FACS of whole
cells. SCO2 –/– cells were treated with NAC for 24 h before ROS measurement (n = 3). (b)
Rescue of SCO2 –/– cell-colony formation by 3 mM NAC in 20% oxygen condition. Colony
formation of SCO2 –/– cells with or without NAC was quantified (n = 4). (c) Cellular
NADH levels in attached SCO2 +/+ and SCO2 –/– cells imaged by ultraviolet laser confocal
microscopy (green fluorescence). Differential interference contrast (DIC) phase images
show the respective cell densities. Scale bar, 50 μm. (d) Relative intracellular oxygen levels
([O2]ic) were quantified using high-resolution fluorescent microscopy after transfection of
the phosphorescent oxygen-sensitive probe IC60N. Measurements were performed in a 5%
ambient oxygen-controlled chamber. Complex III inhibitor antimycin A (+ AA, 5 μM) was
added to demonstrate the dependence of [O2]icon active respiration. The [O2]ic levels shown
are relative to those in non-respiring SCO2 –/– cells in 5% oxygen-saturated medium (n =
7). (e) Effect of ambient oxygen on ROS production in SCO2 –/– cells. Cells were
maintained at the indicated oxygen concentration for 7–10 days before DCF FACS analysis
(n = 3). Values shown as mean and s.e.m.; P-values determined by Student's t-test.
