Figure 1. Disruption of respiration dissociates the toxic effects of oxygen from the bioenergetic
benefits of oxidative phosphorylation
Recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated homologous recombination was used to
derive human HCT116 cell lines with biallelically disrupted SCO2 (SCO2 –/–)24. (a) SCO2
protein assessed by western blotting. β-Actin was probed as loading control. Whole-cell
oxygen consumption measurements in nmol per min per 106 cells and lactate generation in
nmol per min per mg protein (n = 3). (b) Growth sensitivity of SCO2 +/+ and SCO2 –/–
cells to 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) (n = 3). (c) The relative total cellular ATP levels of
SCO2 +/+ and SCO2 –/– cells before and after oligomycin addition are shown (n = 3). (d)
Effect of ambient oxygen on steady-state ATP levels, in nmol per mg protein (n = 4). (e)
Relationship between oxygen and cell growth in non-respiring (SCO2 –/–) cells compared
with respiring (SCO2 +/+) cells. The cell number at each oxygen concentration is
represented as a percentage of the optimal oxygen concentration, 20% oxygen for SCO2 +/+
and 1.5% oxygen for SCO2 –/– cells. Average values are from three independent
experiments performed in duplicate (n = 3). (f) Rescue of SCO2 –/– cell-colony formation
by hypoxia (1.5% oxygen). Representative colony formation assay plates are shown for
SCO2 –/– cells plated at different densities, which were quantified by counting colony
