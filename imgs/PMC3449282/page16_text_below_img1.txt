Molecular and cellular mechanisms by which HIF-1 promotes metastasis of hypoxic breast
cancer to the lungs. Hypoxia in the primary tumor induces the activity of HIF-1 (and HIF-2)
in breast cancer cells, leading to increased transcription of genes encoding proteins that
subsequently promote metastasis. The expression of L1CAM on the cell surface of
circulating breast cancer cells increases their adherence to the endothelial cells (ECs) of
pulmonary blood vessels (margination), whereas the secretion of ANGPTL4 decreases ECâ€“
EC interactions, which promotes the extravasation of breast cancer cells into the lung
parenchyma. Prior to the arrival of breast cancer cells, a pre-metastatic niche forms in the
lung through the activity of LOX/LOXL proteins, which are secreted by hypoxic breast
