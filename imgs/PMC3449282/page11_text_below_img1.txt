Mechanisms and consequences of HIF activation in hypoxic breast cancer cells. (a) In well
oxygenated cells, HIF-1α (and HIF-2α) are subjected to two O2-dependent hydroxylation
reactions. (i) FIH-1 hydroxylates asparagine-803, which prevents HIF-1α from interacting
with the coactivator p300 and renders it transcriptionally inactive. (ii) PHD2 hydroxylates
proline-402 and/or proline-564, which allows HIF-1a to interact with VHL and renders it
subject to ubiquination and proteasomal degradation. (b) In hypoxic cells, the hydroxylation
reactions are inhibited, HIF-1a and HIF-2a accumulate, dimerize with HIF-1b, recruit p300,
bind to target genes, and activate their transcription, leading to the expression of L1 cell
adhesion molecule (L1CAM), angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), lysyl oxidase (LOX), and
