Figure 4.
Local and distant effects of LOX. (a) LOX (and LOXL proteins) crosslink collagen proteins,
thereby altering the physical properties of the ECM. (a) Crosslinking of ECM proteins by
LOX in the primary tumor promotes local cancer cell invasion. (b) Secretion of LOX into
the circulation results in ECM remodeling at distant sites such as the lungs, which promotes
metastasis.
