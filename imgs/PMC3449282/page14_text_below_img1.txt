Figure 3.
Pro-metastatic effects of proteins secreted by hypoxic breast cancer cells. Breast cancer cells
in the primary tumor are subjected to hypoxia, which induces the expression of LOX and
ANGPTL4. (a) In the primary tumor, LOX is secreted into the circulation (i) and crosslinks
collagen in the lungs, leading to the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells that together
define the pre-metastatic nice (ii). (b) A circulating tumor cell from the hypoxic primary
tumor that has adhered to endothelial cells (ECs) in a pulmonary blood vessel secretes
ANGPTL4, which inhibits ECâ€“EC interaction, thereby facilitating the extravasation of the
breast cancer cells into the lung parenchyma.
