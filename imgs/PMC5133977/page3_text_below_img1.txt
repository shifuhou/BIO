Figure 1 Effects of hypoxia preconditioning on the proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). (a) MSCs were differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes, and
chondrocytes under normoxic or hypoxic conditions in vitro. Adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation was examined by oil red O, alkaline phosphatase, and
safranin O staining, respectively. Scale bar = 200 μm. (b) Adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation was examined by fabp2, osteopontin, and sox9 gene
expression using quantitative real-time PCR. (c) Schematic of single-cell assays using MSCs. Scale bar = 200 μm. (d) Normoxic MSCs (Nor-MSC) and hypoxia-preconditioned
MSCs (Hypo-MSC) were grown in single-cell cultures for 0, 5, and 10 days, stained with Giemsa (Scale bar = 100 μm), and (e) the percentage of single MSCs undergoing at least
one cell division after 1, 5, and 10 days of culture. Values represent means ± S.E.M. **Po0.01 versus Nor-MSC
