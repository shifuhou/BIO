Figure 4 Assessment of functional recovery in a murine hindlimb ischemia model. (a) Western blot analysis of PrPC expression in MSCs pretreated with PrPC-specific shRNA
(sh-PRNP). (b) Blood flow recovery was evaluated via laser Doppler imaging analysis of the ischemic sites of mice injected with PBS, normoxic mesenchymal stem cells (Nor-
MSC), hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs (Hypo-MSC), hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs transfected with PrPC-specific shRNA (sh-PRNP Hypo-MSCs), and hypoxia-preconditioned
MSCs transfected with scrambled shRNA (Scr shRNA Hypo-MSCs) at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days post surgery. (c) The ratio of blood perfusion (blood flow in the left ischemic
limb/blood flow in the right non-ischemic limb) was measured in each of the five treatment groups. Values represent means ± S.E.M. **Po0.01 versus PBS; ##Po0.01 versus
Nor-MSCs and sh-PRNP Hypo-MSCs. (d) Representative images illustrating the different outcomes (foot necrosis, toe loss, and limb salvage) observed for ischemic limbs in the
five treatment groups at postoperative day 25. Distribution of the different outcomes in each group. (e) Necrosis of muscle tissues in the ischemic hindlimb was confirmed by
hematoxylin and eosin staining. Scale bar = 100 μm
