Figure 2. Preimplantation development rates of embryos
derived from IVF and cultured under each culture system.
Rates of development to the 2-cell (A) and morula/blastocyst (B) stages
for each culture system. Vivo-K: Zygotes produced in vivo and cultured
in KSOM. IVF-C: IVF-derived zygotes cultured in CZB medium. IVF-K: IVF-
derived zygotes cultured in KSOM. Within columns, values with
different letters are significantly different (P,0.05, x2 tests).
