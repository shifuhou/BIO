Figure 3. Blastocyst quality after culture in each culture system. (A) Expanded blastocysts cultured for 96 h under each culture system. (a)
Control, (b) Air-Oven, (c) DeO2-Oven and (d) MixG-Oven. (B) Immunostaining of blastocysts at 96 h after IVF for Oct3/4 (red) (a, e, i, m), a marker for
the inner cell mass (ICM); for CDX2 (green) (b, f, j, n), a marker for trophectoderm (TE); and with DAPI for staining DNA (c, g, k, o). Merged images are
shown for Oct3/4 and CDX2 (d, h, i, p). (a–d) Control. (e–h) Air-Oven: the bag was filled with air and kept in the oven at 37uC. (i–l) DeO2-Oven: the
deoxidizing agent was put into the bag, which was then kept in the oven. (m–p) MixG-Oven: the bag was filled with a gas mixture (see methodology)
and kept in the oven. Original magnification 6400. (C) Numbers of ICM and TE cells compared between culture systems. (D) Numbers of apoptotic
cells in blastocysts cultured in each culture system. Within columns, values with different letters are significantly different (P,0.05, Student’s t-tests).
