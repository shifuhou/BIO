Figure 1. Experimental procedure and culture systems. (A) Schematic diagram of the experimental procedure and each culture system. Air-
Oven experiment: the bag was filled with air and kept in an oven at 37uC. DeO2-Oven experiment: the deoxidizing agent was put into the bag, which
was then kept in the oven. MixG-Oven experiment: the bag was filled with a gas mixture (see methodology) and kept in the oven. DeO2-WP
experiment: the deoxidizing agent was put into the bag, which was then placed on a warming plate at 37uC. (B) The hermetically sealed plastic bag
with a deoxidizing agent is indicated by an arrow. (C) The O2 concentration was regulated by the deoxidizing agent and measured using the oxygen
meter (arrowhead). (D) After removal of the deoxidizing agent from the plastic bag.
