Fig. 3.  Identification of  a  novel γ-secretase-dependent  cleavage  site.  (A) Radiosequencing of  CTFγ. CTFγ  generated  in vitro from membrane  preparations  of
[35S]methionine-labeled HEK 293 cells stably co-expressing swAPP and wild-type PS1 was subjected  to radiosequencing. A  major peak of radioactivity was
observed at cycle 2 and a second peak at cycle 32 of the Edman degradation. The corresponding amino acid sequence of CTFγ starting at valine 50 is shown above.
The same result was obtained in independent sequencing runs. (B) Mutation of valine 50 of the β-amyloid domain does not interfere with CTFγ generation. Upper
and middle panel, membrane preparations of HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing swAPP or swAPP V50G were analyzed for the levels of βAPP holoprotein,
CTFβ, CTFα and CTFγ by combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting with antibody 6687. The asterisk denotes the mature form of endogenous βAPP751.
Lower  panel,  membrane  preparations  were  incubated at  37°C  for  1  h, and CTFγ  was  analyzed  from  S100  fractions by  immunoblotting  with  antibody  6687.
(C) Detection of a truncated CTFγ in living HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing swAPP. Membrane fractions of HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing swAPP or
cell lysates of HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with cDNA encoding a recombinant CTFγ starting either at amino acid 50 (rCTFγ50) or at amino acid 43
(rCTFγ57) were analyzed by combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting with antibody 6687 to the C-terminus of βAPP. Note that the in vivo produced CTFγ
migrates faster than rCTFγ57 recombinant fragment.
