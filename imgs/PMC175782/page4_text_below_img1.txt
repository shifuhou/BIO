Fig. 3. PHD2 silencing upregulates HIF-1a in all of the human cell lines so far analysed. Immunoﬂuorescence staining showing cells transfected with
20 nM of an irrelevant siRNA (Control or C) or the PHD2 siRNA (PHD2) using the anti-HIF-1a antibody. As a positive control, cells were incubated
in the presence of Co2+ (200 mM) for 4 h. The following cells are shown: CAL51 (breast cancer cell line), RCC4/pVHL (RCC4 stably transfected with
pCDNA3pVHL), WM9 (melanoma cell line) and FHN (primary ﬁbroblasts).
