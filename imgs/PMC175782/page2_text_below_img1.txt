Fig. 1. Speciﬁc silencing of PHD isoforms using siRNAs. Northern blot
showing total RNA isolated from HeLa cells after 48 h of transfection
with the indicated siRNAs (20 nM). Blots were hybridized with 32P-
labelled probes speciﬁc for PHD1, PHD2, PHD3 or 36B4 (loading
control). Inset shows localization of the PHD region targeted by the
two independent sets of siRNAs (ﬁlled squares and double asterisks).
