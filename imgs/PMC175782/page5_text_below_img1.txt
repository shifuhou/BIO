Fig. 5. PHD2 controls HIF-1a stability upon re-oxygenation of hypoxic
cells. HeLa cells transfected with siRNAs (200 nM) were incubated in
normoxia (N; 20% O2) or hypoxia (H; 1–2% O2) for 4 h, after which
hypoxic cells were returned to 20% O2 for 0–180 min. Total cellular
extracts were immunoblotted with the anti-HIF-1a antibody.
