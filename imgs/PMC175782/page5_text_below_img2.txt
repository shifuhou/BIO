Fig. 6. phd2 is a hypoxia-inducible gene. (A) Speciﬁcity of the anti-
PHD2 antibody. Western blot of total cell extracts of HeLa cells after
48 h of transfection with the indicated siRNAs (20 nM) using an anti-
PHD2 antibody. (B) PHD2 is upregulated by hypoxia. Western blot
showing the hypoxic induction of PHD2. Immunoblotting was per-
formed using total cellular extracts of HeLa cells incubated in norm-
oxia (N; 20% O2) or hypoxia (1–2% O2) for different periods of time.
(C) Hypoxic induction of PHD2 is HIF-1 dependent. Western blot of
total cell extracts of HeLa cells transfected in either the absence or
presence of a human HIF-1a siRNA. Immunoblotting was performed
with antibodies against HIF-1a and PHD2.
