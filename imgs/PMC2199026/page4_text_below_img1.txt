Figure 3. Quantitative analysis of SRC after ex vivo culture. (A) Rep-
resentative Southern blot analysis of individual NOD/SCID mice trans-
planted with expanded cells from replicate wells at days 4 and 9. Lane 1
represents one mouse transplanted with the contents of one well contain-
ing 2,200 expanded cells, lanes 2–4 represent three individual mice trans-
planted with 730 expanded cells recovered from one well, lanes 5–12 rep-
resent  eight  mice  transplanted  with  275  expanded  cells  recovered  from
one well, all at day 4. At day 9, two mice were transplanted with 4,500
and  1,250  expanded  cells  (lanes  13–14  and  15–16,  respectively).  DNA
was extracted from the murine BM 8 wk after transplant and hybridized
with a human chromosome 17–specific (cid:97)-satellite probe. (B) Summary of
the level of human cell engraftment in the BM of 81 mice transplanted
with expanded CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:50) cells at 4 d from 10 CB samples.
