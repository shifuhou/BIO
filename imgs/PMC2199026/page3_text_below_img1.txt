Figure 2. Analysis of CD34 and CD38 expression of highly purified populations before and after in vitro culture. A representative experiment (n (cid:53) 3)
of CD34 and CD38 cell surface expression performed on initially purified CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:50) and CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:49) cells, and purified cells after 4 and 9 d of
culture in serum-free conditions. The entire contents of individual wells was collected at 4 and 9 d (5,000â€“9,000 cells), stained with monoclonal antibod-
ies, and analyzed using flow cytometric analysis.
