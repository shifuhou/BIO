Increase  in  cell  number  after  in  vitro  culture  of  CD34(cid:49)
Figure  1.
CD38(cid:50) and CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:49) cells. Purified cells were counted and seeded
(25â€“2,000) in wells containing serum free media (day 0). Cells were har-
vested from individual wells after 4 and 9 d, counted, and the mean fold
increase  in  absolute  cell  number  of  CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:50)  (solid  bar)  and
CD34(cid:49)CD38(cid:49) (shaded bar) cells was calculated.
