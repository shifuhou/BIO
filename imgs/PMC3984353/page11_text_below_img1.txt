Figure 1. BM vascular density and oxygenation
(a) Intravital maximum intensity image (~75 μm thick) of mouse calvarial BM showing 
blood vessels (red, Qtracker 655 vascular dye) and bone (blue, collagen SHG). (b) 
Corresponding single plane of the 3D intravital imaging stack showing blood vessels (red), 
bone SHG (blue), and the 3D Euclidean distance measurement (EDM, green) to the nearest 
blood vessel wall for each extravascular pixel in the BM. (c) Histogram of all EDMs from 
the full 3D imaging stack. (d) BM pO2 is significantly lower compared to pO2 in periosteal 
and cortical bone vessels. Each point represents a pO2 measurement in a separate blood 
vessel or interstitial position (n = 8, 21, 55, and 40 vessels/locations for periosteum, cortical 
bone, BM intravascular, and BM extravascular, respectively, from 8 mice). The mean (black 
line) and ± standard deviation (shaded box) for each data set is shown. (e) Maximum 
intensity projection image montage of a blood vessel entering the BM from the bone. Bone 
(blue) and blood vessels (yellow) are delineated with SHG and RhodamineB-dextran/PtP-
C343 fluorescence, respectively. The two arrows point to locations of pO2 measurements 
just before and after the vessel enters the BM. (f) Drop in pO2 when tracking along
