Figure 4. BM vascular mapping and the effects of cellularity on local pO2 after cytoreductive 
conditioning
(a) Vascular connectivity map of a nestin-GFP mouse reveals that nestin+ vessels are 
upstream of and drain into sinusoids. Arrows indicating blood flow direction, determined by 
tracking the movement of labeled RBCs with video-rate imaging, are superimposed on a 
maximum intensity projection image of BM vasculature (red = vascular dye, green = nestin-
GFP/RBCs, blue = SHG bone signal). A solid green line indicates a vessel with an adjacent 
nestin+ cell and a dashed white line indicates a nestin- vessel. Scale bar ~100 μm. ( b) In vivo 
image of the bone marrow of a universal DsRed recipient 5 days after transplantation with 
25 million total marrow cells from a universal GFP donor. Red = DsRed, Green = GFP, 
Blue = SHG from bone. Scale bar ~100 μm. ( c) Ki-67 staining of green (donor) and red 
(host) BM cells by FACS on day 2 (n = 3 mice) and day 5 (n = 2 mice) after transplantation. 
Each symbol denotes a different mouse. Scale bars (day 2) are the ± standard deviation of 
the mean. (d) The in vivo pO2 values in regions with large clusters of donor cells (n = 19 
locations from 4 mice) compared to small donor clusters/single cells (n = 16 locations from 
4 mice) and host clusters/single cells (n = 40 locations from 5 mice). The mean (black line) 
and ± standard deviation (shaded box) for each data set is shown.
