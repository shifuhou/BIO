Figure 3. BM pO2 after cytoreductive therapy and at sites of HSPC homing
(a) BM pO2 two days after sublethal (4.5 Gy, n = 13 vessels and 29 extravascular locations 
from 5 mice) or lethal (9.5 Gy, n = 40 locations from 2 mice) gamma irradiation, or after 
busulfan (35 mg/kg, n = 40 locations from 6 mice) conditioning. The untreated control pO2 
from Figure 1d is plotted for comparison. (b) Extravascular pO2 measurements are plotted 
as a function of distance to the bone surface from the measurement location 2 days after 4.5 
Gy irradiation (n = 44 locations from 4 mice). (c) Comparison of pO2 at sites of HSPC 
homing to the overall BM pO2 in busulfan treated recipients (n = 17 HSPCs from 6 mice). 
No statistically significant difference was observed. For (a) and (c), the mean (black line) 
and Â± standard deviation (shaded box) for each data set is shown.
