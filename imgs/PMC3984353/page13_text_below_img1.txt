Figure 2. Variation in BM pO2 according to vessel diameter and distance from the endosteal 
surface
(a) Average vessel diameter (green line, n = 38 vessels from 4 mice) and intravascular (red 
line, n = 38 vessels from 4 mice) and extravascular (blue line, n = 39 locations from 3 mice) 
pO2 are plotted as a function of the distance from the bone surface to the measurement 
location. Error bars are the ± standard deviations. (b) The diameter of nestin+ (red circles, n 
= 9 vessels from 3 mice) and nestin- vessels (blue squares, n = 12 vessels from 3 mice) are 
plotted as a function of the distance from the endosteal surface. (c) The pO2 of the same 
nestin+ and nestin- vessels are plotted as a function of vessel diameter. (d) Nestin+ (red 
circles, n = 17 vessels from 7 mice) and nestin- (blue squares, n = 16 vessels from 5 mice) 
vessel pO2. The mean (black line) and ± standard deviation (shaded box) for each data set is 
shown.
