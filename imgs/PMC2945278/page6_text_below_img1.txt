Fig. S1. Morphology and multilineage differentiation potential of WJ-MSCs cultured under hypoxic and normoxic condition 
till late passages. WJ-MSCs (P10-P13) were investigated for in vitro multilineage differentiation capacity when cultured under 
hypoxia and normoxia. Adipogenesis was confirmed by neutral oil droplet formation stained with Oil Red O at day 18 (B & 
C). Formation of mineralized matrix was detected by von Kossa staining at day 21 (E & F). Chondrogenic differentiation 
(n=2) was demonstrated by Alcian blue staining (H & I), 4x objective. Phase contrast images of adipogenesis (J), osteogenesis 
(K) and chondrogenesis (L). Non-induced control cultures in growth medium without adipogenic (A), osteogenic (D) or 
chondrogenic differentiation (G) stimuli are shown. Morphology of WJ-MSCs, cultured under normoxia and hypoxia, as 
observed  at  passage  9  (M  &  N).  Representative  results  of  three  independent  experiments  are  shown.  Abbreviation: 
WJ-MSCs- Wharton’s Jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells. (Scale bar for A, B, C =25µm; D-F and J-N=50µm).
