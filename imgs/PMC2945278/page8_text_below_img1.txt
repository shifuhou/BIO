Fig.  2. Detection of surface marker expression of WJ-MSCs cultured under hypoxia and normoxia by flow cytometry 
analysis. WJ-MSCs were cultured for ten passages under hypoxia and normoxia, labeled with the indicated antibodies and 
analyzed by flow cytometry. An open area represents an antibody isotype control for background fluorescence and a shaded 
area shows signal from MSC surface marker antibodies. Representative histograms are depicted. Abbreviations: WJ-MSC- 
Whartonâ€™s Jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells.
