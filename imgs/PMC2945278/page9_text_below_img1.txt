Fig. 3. Karyotype and RT-PCR analysis of transformation markers and notch pathway genes and validation of array data for 
WJ-MSCs cultured under hypoxia and normoxia. (A) Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of 
DNA repair, tumor suppressor and oncogenes of WJ-MSCs cultured under hypoxic and normoxic conditions for 10 pas-
sages. Expression of genes RAD51, ERCC3, XRCC4, p21 and p53 were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR using SYBR green 
reagent and values are normalised to expression of 18s ribosomal RNA. Bars represent the mean ± SE of the ratio of 
message expressed under hypoxia as compared to that under normoxia for three independent experiments performed in 
duplicate. (B) Expression p16 and c-Myc using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Band densities were quantified and plotted. (C) 
Karyotype  analysis  of  WJ-MSCs  using  standard  Giemsa-banding  procedure  represents  Normal  46,  XY  karyotype  of 
WJ-MSCs cultured under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. A representative analysis of three independent experiments is 
shown (E) Abbreviations: WJ-MSCs - Wharton’s Jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells; SE- standard error.
