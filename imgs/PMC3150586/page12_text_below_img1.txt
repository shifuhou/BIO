Traditional view of HIFs in tumor progression. Tumor cells residing closer to blood vessels
are relatively well oxygenated (red), whereas those at more distant sites become hypoxic
(blue). Stabilization of HIF-α proteins in these cells stimulates the expression of numerous
target genes encoding factors that mediate adaptation to the hypoxic stress. Some target
genes are regulated specifically by HIF-1α, such as those encoding glycolytic enzymes
ALDA and PGK, whereas others are specific targets of HIF-2α, such as those encoding
TGF-α and cyclin D1. Most HIF target genes are regulated by both HIF-1α and HIF-2α,
including those encoding the angiogenic cytokine VEGF and the glucose transporter GLUT1
(Raval et al., 2005, and references therein).
