One mode of cancer stem cell generation. Normal stem cells (top) typically divide slowly,
but retain the capacity for apparently limitless self-renewal (circular green arrow).
Asymmetric division of a multipotent stem cell produces one daughter stem cell and one
committed progenitor (or transit amplifying) cell that undergoes a limited, if rapid, series of
divisions. The progeny of this transit amplifying cell differentiate to produce a tissue or
tissues. A stem cell may undergo oncogenic transformation (vertical dashed line) and lose
important homeostatic control mechanisms: the resultant transit amplifying cell and its
progeny may consequently fail to differentiate normally or exhibit normal growth controls,
thereby generating a tumor. Whereas the transformed cancer stem cell retains the property of
self-renewal and can produce new tumors in serial transplantation experiments, its progeny
do not (Huntly and Gilliland, 2005). Growing evidence suggests that progenitor cells can,
under certain circumstances, regain stem cell properties (horizontal dashed lines) (Krivstov
et al., 2006, Morrison and Kimble, 2006).
