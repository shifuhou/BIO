Proposed model for HIF activity in generating cancer stem cells. Cells in hypoxic tumor
regions stabilize HIFs and activate adaptive gene expression (see Figure 1). HIF activity in a
rare subset of hypoxic tumor cells could also enhance the activity or expression of Notch,
Oct4, c-Myc, ABC transporters (ABC-Ts), and telomerase. Increased expression of KLF4,
Sox2, and other factors could promote further dedifferentiation and confer stem cell-like
properties, such as self-renewal (circular green arrow), on what was originally a transformed
cell with limited replicative potential. Inhibition of HIF activity in the resultant cancer stem
cells might block, or reverse, this effect.
