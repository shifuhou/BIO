FIG. 1. Distribution of HIF-1(cid:97) and Arnt mRNAs in human tissues. Total
RNA from the indicated human tissues was used in RNA blotting experiments.
The same ﬁlter was subsequently hybridized with HIF-1(cid:97) and Arnt cDNA probes
following 32P labeling by random priming. For a loading control, the ﬁlter was
analyzed for (cid:98)-actin mRNA expression.
