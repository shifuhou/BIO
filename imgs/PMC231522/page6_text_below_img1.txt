FIG. 5. Inhibition of dioxin responsiveness by CoCl2 treatment of HepG2 cells. (A) HepG2 cells were transfected with the parental reporter gene pT81 or the
XRE-containing reporter pTX.DIR, as indicated. Luciferase activity was monitored from cells treated with 50 nM TCDF in the absence or presence of 150 (cid:109)M CoCl2
for 48 h. Each error bar represents the standard deviation from three independent experiments. Cell extracts were normalized with regard to the protein content. TK,
thymidine kinase promoter. (B) Northern blot analysis of HIF-1(cid:97), aldolase A (ALDA), EPO, and (cid:98)-actin mRNA levels in HepG2 cells. The cells were treated with
either vehicle alone (lane 1) or 50 nM TCDF for 8 h (lane 2). The cells were also pretreated with 150 (cid:109)M CoCl2 for 16 h prior to addition of TCDF (lane 3) and
incubation for an additional 8 h or treated with CoCl2 alone for 24 h (lane 4). (C) Inhibition of P-4501A1 mRNA induction by CoCl2. HepG2 cells were treated with
solvent alone (lane 1), 50 nM TCDF for 8 h (lane 2), or 150 (cid:109)M CoCl2 for 16 h (lane 4). In lane 3, cells were treated with 150 (cid:109)M CoCl2 for 16 h prior to addition
of TCDF for an additional 8 h.
