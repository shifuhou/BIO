FIG. 6. Inhibition of dioxin receptor function by overexpression of HIF-1(cid:97).
HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with the parental pT81 or the XRE-
containing pTX.DIR reporter plasmids together with the HIF-1(cid:97) expression
plasmid pHIF-1(cid:97)/CMV4 or an empty pCMV4 vector. Luciferase activity was
assayed 48 h after transfection. Each bar represents the standard deviation of the
relative luciferase activity from three independent experiments, with values nor-
malized relative to the protein content of each extract.
