FIG. 7. The DNA binding activity of the dioxin receptor is down-regulated
upon exposure to CoCl2. An electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay was per-
formed with nuclear extract prepared from either untreated HepG2 cells (lanes
1 and 9) or HepG2 cells treated with 50 nM TCDF alone for 1 h (lanes 2, 7, 8,
and 10). Cells were also pretreated with 150 (cid:109)M CoCl2 at different time points
prior to addition of TCDF for 1 h (lanes 3 to 5 and 11 to 13) or treated with 150
(cid:109)M CoCl2 alone for 4 h (lanes 6 and 14). Equal amounts of protein from the
different nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides, and
the extracts were analyzed for dioxin receptor-dependent (lanes 1 to 8) or
USF-dependent (lanes 9 to 14) DNA binding activities. Competition experi-
ments were performed by including a 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe (Spec.;
lane 8) or an unrelated oligonucleotide (Unspec.; lane 7). The mobilities of the
dioxin receptor (DR)- and USF-dependent DNA-protein complexes are indi-
cated. Unbound probe is indicated as free probe, and the asterisks indicate
complexes generated by constitutive XRE-speciÔ¨Åc factors.
