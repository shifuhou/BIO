FIG. 8. HIF-1(cid:97) competes with the ligand-activated dioxin receptor for re-
cruitment of the Arnt partner factor. (A) In vitro-translated [35S]methionine-
labeled full-length dioxin receptor was incubated with 5 (cid:109)l of unlabeled in
vitro-translated full-length Arnt in the presence (lanes 2 to 5) or absence (lane
1) of 10 nM dioxin (TCDD). The ligand-activated dioxin receptor was also
incubated without (lanes 1 and 2) or with a 0.5-fold (lane 3), 1-fold (lane 4), or
2-fold (lane 5) molar excess of unlabeled in vitro-translated full-length HIF-1(cid:97) as
described in Materials and Methods. Coimmunoprecipitation was carried out
with Arnt-speciﬁc antiserum, and the coimmunoprecipitated products were vi-
sualized by SDS-PAGE and ﬂuorography. (B) In vitro-translated [35S]methi-
onine-labeled full-length HIF-1(cid:97) was incubated with 5 (cid:109)l of unlabeled in vitro-
increasing
translated full-length Arnt
concentrations of unlabeled dioxin receptor (DR) and then coimmunoprecipi-
tated with Arnt-speciﬁc antiserum. The products were analyzed as described
above. The concentration of [35S]methionine-labeled HIF-1(cid:97) was equivalent to
that of [35S]methionine-labeled dioxin receptor in panel A.
