FIG. 3. Arnt is required for HIF-1(cid:97) function. (A) HeLa cells were transiently cotransfected as described in Materials and Methods with pGLHIF1.3 and expression
vectors for HIF-1(cid:97), Arnt, and Arnt(cid:68)b. Luciferase activity was assayed after 48 h. (B) HeLa cells were transfected with the XRE-containing reporter gene pTX.DIR
and indicated expression plasmids. Luciferase activity obtained was determined following treatment with 50 nM TCDF for 48 h. The results show relative induction
obtained in cells transfected with expression plasmids relative to the activity obtained in cells transfected with the empty pCMV4 expression vector, and cell extracts
were normalized on the basis of protein content. Each bar represents the standard deviation of the relative induction obtained from three independent experiments.
SV40, simian virus 40; TK, thymidine kinase.
