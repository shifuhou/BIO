FIG. 2. Requirement of Arnt for hypoxic regulation of target genes. (A and B) RNA blot analysis of total RNA extracted from wild-type Hepa 1 or Arnt-deﬁcient
Hepa 1C4 cells following simultaneous cultivation at either 20 or 1% oxygen for 4 and 16 h. The same ﬁlter was subsequently hybridized with the indicated cDNA probes
following 32P labeling by random priming. The signal obtained with the ribosomal protein L28 probe was used to correct for differences in loading and blotting. (C)
Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay using nuclear extract prepared from HeLa, Hepa 1, or Hepa 1C4 cells cultured either in 20 or 1% oxygen for 4 h. An 18-bp
HRE oligonucleotide from the EPO gene was used as a probe. (D) To identify Arnt in the HIF-1 complex, nuclear extracts from Hepa 1 and Hepa 1C4 cells were
incubated with anti-Arnt antiserum prior to the DNA binding reaction. Note that the anti-Arnt antiserum recognized a single band in Hepa 1 cells.
