FIG. 9. HIF-1(cid:97) is associated with the molecular chaperone hsp90. Full-
length HIF-1(cid:97) cDNA was in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine
in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, coimmunoprecipitated with hsp90-speciﬁc (S; lane
1) or control immunoglobulin M (C; lane 2) antibody as described in Materials
and Methods, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and ﬂuorography.
