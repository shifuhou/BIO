Figure 1.
Detection of nuclear HIF-1α in paraffin embedded renal biopsy tissue sections from a
patient with IgA nephropathy. (A) Masson Trichrome (MT) stain. Blue staining indicates the
presence of collagen. (B) Immunohistochemical stain for HIF-1α in an adjacent section.
Arrows point to tubular cells expressing HIF-1α. (C) Immunohistochemical stain for FSp1.
Arrows point to FSp1-positive cells associated with fibrotic areas. Magnification ×200.
