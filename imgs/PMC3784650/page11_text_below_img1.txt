Schematic suggesting hypoxia-regulated biological processes and mechanisms through
which HIF activation may promote renal fibrogenesis. HIF signaling appears to play a
pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory responses,55 however the role of HIF
activation with regard to renal injury mediated by inflammatory cells is unclear. Because of
its important role in the initiation and maintenance of kidney injury we have included
`inflammation' in this schematic.
