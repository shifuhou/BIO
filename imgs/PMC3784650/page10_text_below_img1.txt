Hypoxia induces a mesenchymal phenotype in primary renal epithelial cells. Primary cells
were lineage-tagged with a lacZ reporter using Cre-loxP mediated recombination and de
novo expression of fibroblast marker FSp1 was monitored by immunoflourescence. Hypoxia
(5 days, 1% O2) increased the percentage of FSp1 expressing cells. (A–C) Shown is
immunoflourescence staining for lacZ in red (A) and for FSp1 in green (B). Lineage-tagged
epithelial cells, which stain for both lacZ and FSp1 and fluoresce in yellow are shown in
(C). De novo expression of FSp1 indicates that these cells have undergone transition to a
mesenchymal phenotype. (D and E) LacZ and FSp1 immunofluorescence stain of primary
cells exposed to normoxia (D) and hypoxia (E). The percentage of epithelial cells that
express FSp1 de novo increases under hypoxia (yellow fluorescence) as illustrated in (E).
