Figure 3. Effect of hypoxia on UC-MSCs is linked to the mTOR pathway. UC-MSCs underwent control
(21% O2 and INK-128) and experimental conditions (5% O2, <1% O2, 10 µM CoCl2, and 250 µMCoCl2)
for 24 and 48 h, after which protein analysis was carried out via Western blot. (A–C) Protein band
quantiﬁcation of two mTORC1 targets (p-4EBP1/4EBP1 and p-S6K1/S6K1) and a mTORC2 target
(p-Akt/Akt), normalized to the loading control calnexin (CNX). The ratio between phosphorylated
and total forms could be used to infer protein function. (D) Representative immunoblot of the
total and of the respective phosphorylated form of the 4EBP1, S6K1, and Akt proteins. Results are
represented as means with SEM of a minimum of 3 independent experiments. Statistical signiﬁcance
considered when * p < 0.05%, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
